title: 1.4 Language learner types
author: Iversen
---
The notion of learner types  is less discussed here in 2016 than it was in 2009, but it has definitely not become obsolete. There are several systems on the market for describing differences between language learners (and learners in general). One of them is the Felder-Silverman system, which is explained in a concise form in the article "Learning styles and strategies" by Felder [and](http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/ILSdir/styles.htm) Soloman. See also Felder's [list](http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Learning_Styles.html) of resources, which presents its main categories:

*ACTIVE versus REFLECTIVE LEARNERS*  
*SENSING versus INTUITIVE LEARNERS*  
*VISUAL versus VERBAL LEARNERS*  
*SEQUENTIAL versus GLOBAL LEARNERS*  

The following series of quotes from the first of the two articles can give hints about each category, but the descriptions are obvious longer in the article itself, where you also get tips about the way each type functions in a learning situation:
Active learners tend to retain and understand information best by doing something active with it--discussing or applying it or explaining it to others. Reflective learners prefer to think about it quietly first.

*Active learners tend to retain and understand information best by doing something active with it--discussing or applying it or explaining it to others. Reflective learners prefer to think about it quietly first.*  
*Sensing learners tend to like learning facts, intuitive learners often prefer discovering possibilities and relationships.*  
*Visual learners remember best what they see -- pictures, diagrams, flow charts, time lines, films, and demonstrations. Verbal learners get more out of words -- written and spoken explanations. Everyone learns more when information is presented both visually and verbally.*  
*Sequential learners tend to gain understanding in linear steps, with each step following logically from the previous one. Global learners tend to learn in large jumps, absorbing material almost randomly without seeing connections, and then suddenly "getting it."*  

Other systems are based on the so-called Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which ultimately is based on Carl Jung's writings and deals with personality types in general. A concise overview over its categories plus a simple test can be found here: http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types / .  This system has of course also been applied to language learning, for instance in the article "Effect of Personality on Learning Language" by Sepehri, Rakhshani, Keshavarz [and](http://conference.pixel-online.net/ICT4LL2013/common/download/Paper_pdf/287-MTL19-FP-Sepehri-ICT2013.pdf) Kiani as quoted below:

*The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator identifies preferences in four areas: Extroversion vs. Introversion, Sensing (concrete-sequential) vs.Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judging (closure-oriented) vs. Perceiving (closure-oriented).*

*These 8 types of learners differ in the way they learn the language and they have different learning styles. Each of the mentioned eight preferences that goes to make up a psychological type has its assets and liabilities when it comes to language learning.*

*The extroverted learner learns more effectively through concrete experiences, contacts with the outside world, and relationships with others. (...)*  
*The introverted learner learns more effectively in individual, independent situations that are more involved with ideas and concepts. Their strengths are their ability to concentrate on the task in hand as well as their self-sufficiency(...).*

*The sensing learner learns more effectively from reports of observable facts and happenings; prefers physical, sense-based input. (...) they will be hindered should there be a lack of clear sequence, goals or structure in the language or language course.*  
*The intuitive learner learns more effectively from flashes of insight, using their imagination, and 
grasping the general concepts rather than all the details. (...).*

*The thinking learner learns more effectively from impersonal circumstances and logical consequences. Their strengths are in their ability to analyze and their self-discipline. (...)*  
*The feeling learner learns more effectively from personalized circumstances and social values. They have the advantage of their strong desire to bond with the teacher, resulting in good relations which lead to high self-esteem(...)*

*The judging learner learns more effectively by reflection, analysis, and processes that involve closure. They have the advantage of systematically working through a task, and wanting to get the job done. (...).  
The perceiving learner learns more effectively through negotiation, feeling, and inductive processes that postpone closure. Their strong points are their openness, flexibility and adaptability to change and new experiences. (...)*

A third system (or rather distinction) is described in "Identifying Visual-Spatial and Auditory-Sequential Learners: A [Validation](http://visualspatial.org/files/idvsls.pdf) Study" and " Characteristics Comparison between Auditory-Sequential and Visual Spatial Learners", both by Linda Kreger Silverman. The comparative table from the second text starts out like this:

![Table contrasting auditory-sequential and visual-spatial learners.](../1-4-image.jpg)

There are actually more systems available, and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_style) has as usual a useful listing of different systems, but the three above show the variety and kind of distinctions they propose. 

As you can see there is no dearth of theories and writings about learning styles, - the problem is that they is based more on empirical work and simple logic than on scientific studies, and that it has been quite difficult to demonstrate whether the distinctions have in any given theory has any bearings on how a given pupil reacts to different teaching methods. In this situation some academic souls have refused to acknowledge that differences in learning style are relevant for pedagogics -and often also that they exist. And the consequence of this reasoning could be that teachers don't have to take differences among the pupils seriously - everybody can be taught acording to the same model. But then you can of course also ask why teachers should be allowed to use different methods - if pupils can adapt, then teachers can too. 

But even thought pupils (and teachers) may be able to accommodate to methods which they don't like it may not be a good idea to force them to do so. Some learners may be so averse to certain methods that they would stop learning if they were applied - as silly rolegames or songs in my own case (I would simply walk out). And it would be also be a waste of time if methods that would be efficient for certain pupils wouldn't be used because their teacher didn't like them. Like silly rolegames and songs if they had me as their teacher. Or wordlists and grammar books if their teacher was a fanatical adherent to the socalled natural method. So even though it may be difficult to prove that any one set of criteria can describe all the relevant differences between learners then it is evident that people aren't all made in the same mold, and pedagogics should take that into account (and hope that science catches up some day).

At HTLAL I had a discussion with another member about learning styles in 2010. He saw them as mere preferences, while I saw them as deeply rooted, possible innate character traits. But wherever the traits come from: in the large middle group it is certainly possible to both sway a preference and override an inborn, but not extreme character trait and learn to profit from a teaching setup which goes again their learning style (as tested by one of the systems on the market). A strong character trait doesn't have to be an inborn trait similar to the one that makes the cuckoo say "cuckoo" - it is enough that it has been incorporated in the mindset of the learner and maybe even used with success.

To really test the theories about learning styles you would have to find two extreme pupil groups, divide each one into half and teach half the resulting groups in a way their members hated and presumably wouldn't profit from. Even if this last prediction turned out to be wrong, the experiment would still be inhumane and probably impossible to control over a long period - after all the test persons would have a life outside the laboratories, and there they could do all sorts of things without telling some nosy test administrator. 

Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer and Bjork write in their [abstract](http://psi.sagepub.com/content/9/3/105.abstract) from "Learning Styles - Concepts and Evidence": 

*Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method (...)  There is (..) plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis*

Please notice the last sentence: "*Very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education."* Spot on! Maybe that explains why there isn't much experimental evidence to prove that the proposed learners types are relevant for the choice of teaching methods. But while we wait I would prefer being taught without silly dialogues, songs, competitions and multiple choice tests. Instead I want to learn languages globally rather than sequentially, and I want to learn them by amassing  words, grammatical knowledge and useful expressions from all over a given language. With some training I expect one day to wake up and be able to read, understand, write and maybe even speak it. 

But before you can use genuine texts and conversations as resources you have to be able to understand at least some of the words and phrases, and textbooks for beginners are always written in a sequential way.

One problem with sequential learning is the expectation that you should learn everything perfectly before you proceed to the next item or lesson. For me it isn't important whether there are errors in your first utterances, - the important thing is to 'get the machine rolling', and then you can weed out the errors later. Getting 'the big picture' from the start is very important for me, but most text books are based on the opposite principle: giving information in tiny little pieces in order not to scare the pupils. That is one good reason not to use them as intended, but they may still function as sources for ultra-easy texts and things like that. 

My study methods are also to a high degree based on written materials, whereas actual communication with others is relegated to a stage where I already know the language fairly well. Most language learners would however prefer to speak to somebody from the start while they are learning a language, and some would in fact loose every shred of motivation without a social context, - for them green grammar sheets, wordlists and hyperliteral translations would probably not be very tempting.

To end this chapter I would like to mention a splendid book on the internet with examples of different learning styles exemplified with real case stories: "Success with Foreign Languages - Seven who achieved it and what worked for them" by Earl W. [Stewick](http://www-01.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/BooksBackInPrint/SuccessWithForeignLanguages/success.pdf). Its seven 'learner types' (two persons of each type) are called the intuitive learner, the formal learner, the informal learner, the imaginative learner, the active learner, the deliberate learner and - the special star of the show - the self-aware learner.
