So you decide that a certain word is worth reading and somehow you find out how what it means. What now? At your disposal are a number of memorization techniques.

Many of the types of associations that I mention below are not easily available to a total newbee: etymology, similar words in the target language, quotes from publicity and TV series etc. As a general rule a newbee will have to base his/her 'memory hooks' primarily on things outside the target language, - but this phase will of course be shorter with an easier language (which typically is a language that closely resembles one you already know). 

First problem: how do you as a beginner discover the meaning of a word or word combination? Well, somebody can point to a fourlegged animal and say "cheval". That's what French parents do, and after 100 repetitions (with different kinds of horses) their child has constructed a mental image of what a "cheval" is. But if I'm learning French as an adult chances are that I will see the word in a textbook with a wordlist, and if not, then I'll look the word up in a dictionary and get the information that a "cheval" is a 'horse' (or in Danish: 'en hest'). And then I take over the Danish concept "hest" and apply it on the French word "cheval". And that's a liability, but it is nevertheless the easiest way to grasp the meaning of "chavel" fast. 

When you already have learnt some very simple words you can use them to learn less obvious words, as "ici" in "cheval ici". This is however not just a long-term training of reflexes as postulated by the behaviourists, but rather an active construction process which you feed with chunks of language, almost like you feed a child with cheeseburgers and carrots and chocolate. 

When speaking about associations, which you can use as 'memory hooks' the simple **imagery** method is the one that is closest to the way the word "cheval" was taught above. And one of the simple things you can do as a language learner is to imagine the things you learn. So while memorizing the word "cheval" then draw mental images of big horses, tiny horses and famous horses in your mind. With verbs like "fight" or "eat" you can imagine small videoclips showing mighty battles or heavy eating, etc. The only catch is that some persons seem to have problems making up those mental images. Mental imaging is also possible if you make wordlists from dictionaries, and it might take out some of the potential dreariness of that method. When you use dictionaries a simple trick is to 'see' the spelled word at the same time you imagine (or actually say) how it sounds. 

Does it help? Well, some learners benefit more from imagery than others, but there is a catch. I once read about an experiment which was supposed to test the claim that there are visual learners, and that these learn better if they use pictures during the memorization process. The researchers therefore told a test group to memorize words while they showed them pictures. A control group wasn't supplied with pictures, and its members learned words at least as efficiently - maybe even better. So the conclusion was that visual learners either don't exist or that they didn't learn better with imagery than without. 

The problem is that the poor test kids were expected to learn not one, but two separate things (a word and a picture), whereas the test group only had to learn one thing (a word). To function properly a mental image must be fused with the word you try to learn so that they form one single item. These uses of imagery resemble, but aren't not quite the same thing as the use of puns to remember words and expressions. A pun is not an image of the thing itself, but a joke based on its written or spoken form. 

HTLAL member [Fanatic](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=18830) once gave an example of this method:

*"Cochon is pig in English. How do we remember that? Cochon sounds like cushion. We join the sound alike, cushion, to the meaning, pig. I picture having small pigs on my lounge instead of cushions and I tell my visitors, pull up a pig and take a seat. That reminds me of the meaning of cochon. It tells me that cochon is French for pig."*

As you see it is the outer shape of the word "cochon" that is used for the pun, which then is visualized in the hope that the image will stay in your mind forever. I do believe that many people can profit from this method, but personally I find it somewhat disruptive and cumbersome to have to invent those irrelevant puns while studying a list of words. For me simple imagery has the same effect, but it is worth trying both methods. 

![Painting of a dog exclaiming kläff-kläff.](../2-4-image-1.jpg)

Once upon a time at HTLAL someone wanted to remember the German word "kläffen" which means 'to bark'. If you want to remember this then you should imagine a barking dog which says the word, not a barking dog which says "bow wow" and a word "kläffen" somewhere else. I have tried to illustrate this in the painting above, but your complex visualizations (if possible with sound, smell and  texture) should be forged by YOU and not by me if they are to function as intended.

There are other memory hooks which aren't based on imagery: a word may remind you of **other words** in the target language or some other language, or you may remember it because you associate it with a **situation**, like seeing it used in a specific book. 

For the advanced language learner memory tags that are based on target-language information will become ever more important as you add more and more background knowledge. The most obvious application of this is of course the formation of word families (cfr the chapter on word counts), but also 'families' based on affixes. Like when you already know twenty words with the prefix "ter-" in Indonesian and just have to remember that such a derivation exists for a new root - you don't have to remember the actual word.

With this in mind it is clear that wordlists function best for learners who already are at least intermediate and maybe more. One reason is of course that the words you choose aren't really unknown - you may have seen them many times, but didn't remember them. But the main reason is that a given word or expression may remind you of other target language words and expression - for instance through shared prefixes, etymology or similar meaning. 

This is not very different from memorizing a word with its translation(s) as seen in a dictionary. Higher skill level means that you can avoid references to other languages, but sometimes it pays to keep those references to other languages - like for instance when you have to memorize the gender of  French nouns. If you know the corresponding Italian or Spanish words then the difference between -o (masculine) and -a (feminine) normally tell you the correct gender even in French. This is an example of an intralinguistic association, but more often you use these to remember - or infer - the meaning of a word.  For instance a "telpon" in Bahasa Indonesia is a telephone - the similarity is clear. One you have learnt this word you can use it to learn other words, like "**men**elpon" - 'call somebody'. The "men-" is a prefix which has a tendency to change or eat the first sound in the root that follows - here the t- of "telpon" disappears and leave "-elpon" as part of the new compound.

In other cases you only exploit a similarity in sound, as with Fanatic's "cochon" above. It is generally not necessary to find phrases that sound like the whole of the word  or word combination you want to memorize - it is just as efficient to mimic the beginning of it. But once you have found a suitable 'memory hook', it's your job to create the kind of fusion between that thing and your problem word. Memory artists have typically memorized long series of elements, and they then forge associations between these predetermined elements and the words or things they want to remember. And in this way they can remember not only a lot of elements, but also remember them in the right order. As already mentioned  the 'Memory Palace' technique is an application of this. But the order is generally irrelevant for language learning, and as far as I can judge from myself and testimony from other learners these techniques aren't used much. Instead we use isolated and unsystematic associations, either of the intralinguistic kind or of the sound-based kind.

And then what about situational associations? It has somehow become popular to claim that vocabulary can't be learned without a context. I admit that a relevant context actually can help you to forge the kind of syncretistic complex I just described, but it is an exaggeration to claim that you ONLY can learn vocabulary with a context. I would like to refer you to a classic mass myth debunking done by the Dutchman Mondria in the article "[Myths](http://babylonia.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/2007-2/mondria.pdf) about vocabulary acquisition". He mentions seven myths, and for pedagogical reasons let's have a look at the whole list, even though it is the question of context which is under scrutiny here:

* *Myth 1: “Knowing a relatively small  number of words takes you far.”*
* *Myth 2: “Word lists are of limited value.”*
* *Myth 3: “Presenting words in semantic sets facilitates learning.”*
* *Myth 4: “Words should always be learned in context.”*
* *Myth 5: “Words whose meanings have been inferred from context are retained better.”*
* *Myth 6: “Words learned productively are retained better.”*
* *Myth 7: “Vocabulary knowledge should not be tested separately.”*

About myth no. 4 he writes: 

*For example, someone can learn the French word 'canne' with the help of  the sentence  'Le vieil homme marche à l’aide d’une canne.' (...)However, there are two caveats to this ‘rule of thumb’. First, many (concrete) words can be learned efficiently without context. Presenting such words without a context – for example when a learner asks for them – can be a practical method that prevents the teacher from having to invent an interesting or useful context, (...)Second, and this is actually the main point, learning a word in a particular context may result in a learner knowing the word only in that context,.*

About myth no. 5 he writes:  
*In order to investigate whether inferring is an effective learning strategy, I carried out a learning experiment with Dutch pupils in secondary education (Mondria 1996, 2003). They had to learn French words (French-Dutch) with the aid of four different learning methods: (...)The learning effect of  inferring per se is rather limited: after two weeks, only 6% of the inferred word meanings were remembered. The addition of a verifying stage led to an extra retention of 9%. However, it is only when the word meanings are intentionally memorized that the learning effect becomes substantial, as shown by the retention figures of the meaning-inferred method (47%) and the meaning-given method (50%).*

![Learning of effect of inferring in Dutch high school students learning French. Pure inferring has the lowest score, 5% receptive retention, while the of memorization scores at almost or at 50%.](../2-4-image-2.jpg)

So the idea that you should avoid dictionaries is obviously wrong. On the contrary: if you are in doubt about the meaning of a word then get the problem solved as fast as possible. 

Mondria's fear that a context may be too strongly attached to a given word is less well-founded. It is definitely a good idea to use short snippets of text with just enough information as tools to remember things the gender of substantives or the construction possibilities of verbs. For instance you can memorize German substantives whose gender isn't obvious with an article and maybe an adjective, and I can't see why that particular article or adjective should become inseparable from  the substantive. For instance it is safe to memorize that that "Zeit" (time) is femininum by memorizing the name of the newspaper "Die Zeit" - the article won't cling to the word in situations where you don't need it. But there is no need to do the same with "Stunde" (hour), because the final -e is a clear marker that the word is feminine. It is enough the do memory tricks to remember the words that __don't__ follow a simple rule of thumb. 

Longer sentences are generally irrelevant for this purpose. If your goal is to remember that it is "più di" in Italian then just memorize a passage with 3-4 words. Trying to memorize it as part as a long complicated quote from some famous author will just remove the focus from the essential information. 

In some memory systems you try to establish associations that follow a previously memorized pattern, and this can be used for fast memorization of long rows of data, - for instance packs of cards or numbers. This is the idea behond the socalled memory palaces, where you visualize a series of things you want to remember with places in a building or street you know well. To aid you to remember less visually impressive information there are systems to help you - for instance some memory artists have systems to convert numbers into images, which they then can use in making associations. But at the end of the day I'm sceptical about systems based on prelearned structures when it comes to ordinary language learning. Apart from numerals the order of the words you need to learn is completely irrelevant, and you don't have to remember each and every word in a random collection - better learn a number of words or expressions outside the collection than worrying about those that were in the original selection. If you do want to use such techniques and want some suggestions about ways to do it you might have a look at [Metivier](http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com)'s 'magnetic method' and the memory palaces of Matteo Ricci. 

So what do you really need? In the first place most people should train the ability to form loose associations on the fly from the sound of words - or even of parts of them. It is better to make an association based on just the beginning of a word if you can do it fast than it is to discover a really sneaky association several minutes later. The other thing which should be trained is actually using those associations during memorization instead of mere repetition. If you make it a habit of yours to make associations then your mind will automatically create more and better associations.

Besides the types already mentioned there is a whole world of situational associations: you can remember a word because you didn't know what to say in a certain situation, or you may remember it because some special person used it, or you saw it is a specific text . But there are people who are much more dependent on human interaction during their language learning - and therefore probably also better to utilize it to provide situational memory hooks. I do know that I remember words better when I use them, but that's about as close as I get to use that kind of hooks.
