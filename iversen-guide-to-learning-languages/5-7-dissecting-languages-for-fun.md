title: 5.7 Dissecting languages for fun
author: Iversen
---
There are areas in the world where one language is so dominating that learning other languages isn't necessary, and if you nevertheless do so the choice will typically be English or another 'world language'. There are other places where it may be necessary to learn one language to speak to your neighbour and another to buy groceries at the market. And the authorities will communicate with you in third or fourth language. In such a place the problem is not to explain why you should learn more than one language, but you may still be in a situation where you have to explain why you choose to learn a language which isn't necessary for your bare survival. In Denmark English has become so intrusive that you can't avoid it, but other languages are under pressure. Due to new rules dictated by the government one of our universities - Sydjysk Universitetscenter - has just announced that it will drop all courses and research in Chinese, Arabic and Spanish, leaving only English and German. Other universities try to keep a wider range of language alive, but too many decision makers believe that English is all you need. 

When I studied French in the 70s at the university in Århus we had an institute for Romance languages, and 125 students started to learn French in the same year as me. Many seeped away, but we still had lots of students and a gamut of teachers who offered very different courses. Some twenty years later or so later I saw that the new intake per year was down to 25 students, and while I write this the French studies have been lumped together in a far corner of "Arts"  with other small and insignificant languages.  Chinese and Arabic have been incorporated into area studies, where you study the culture as much as a language. I actually don't know whether you can pass an exam there exclusively by using English articles and reports, but the languages will inevitably suffer in such a setting. And the downwards spiral continues.

So my conclusion is that language learning for fun may become the rescue for anything apart from English and a handful of other languages with sufficient commercial clout. 

I could in principle survive with just Danish and English, and the main effect would be that my travels would be somewhat less interesting. But I already have to survive on English if I visit the far East or parts of Africa so that wouldn't be a  novel experience. My main motivation for studying a few languages more than necessary is .. knowing those languages. And adding new ones is like visiting new countries or towns or reading about advances in science. 

There may other benefits to multilingualism. It has been claimed that multilingualism delays Alzheimer, but some studies has raised doubts about this (Like the '[nun](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/739948) experiment', which puts the blame in something called the ApoE4 allele, i.e. on genetic factors). Nevertheless it seems logical that you brain benefits from training, and learning new languages is certainly a way to put it to work. 

Let's look at the process from a language learning perspective. In the chapter about associations (2.4) I mentioned innerlinguistic associations as one of the most efficient ways to memorize new words. You can compare the meaning of a word with the neurons of a brain cell: if it gets a stimulus from any of its neurons, it gets excited. So the more connections the better. A fluent speaker has met each word many times and attached new memories to it. And the goal of the association making in memorization is to form a mesh of 'memory hooks' which will make it more likely that you can recall that word later. A simple picture may do the trick, but a linguistic association leads to other words, and from there the process can continue. 

It is often stated that learning the first foreign language is hard, but after that it becomes easier with every new anguage. When you think of the benefits of learning related languages it is evident that it is an advantage to get a lot of words for free, either identical or just with minor changes. This is not limited to sister languages like Spanish and Portuguese or Danish and Norwegian, but thanks to loan words it also holds true for more distant languages. That there is such a thing as a shared vocabulary in related languages is obvious in cases like Spanish "posada" / Portuguese "pousada". Why? Because there are lots and lots of words which have "o" in Spanish and "ou" in Portuguese. Why? Because these two language have a common ancestor in the form of Vulgar Latin, and historical linguists have constructed socalled 'sound laws' (or in less commiting terms: 'sound shifts')  to explain the differences. It is evident that seeing a number of examples of a certain shift can help you to see parallels with other word pairs. It is less obvious whether reading about the changes in scientific lingo will help you to grasp them. Unless you have a solid education in phonology you'll learn more from looking at the concrete examples.

The second source of shared vocabulary is loanwords, where a word is taken over 'as is' or  with minor changes due to the sound system and spelling rules of the recipient. Once you have noticed that "post" became "pos" in Bahasa Indonesia you are obviously prepared to look for more examples. There is a very comprehensive analysis of the loanwords in Dutch in the article "Loanwords in Dutch" by N.van der Seis in the "[Loanwords](https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/files/475024/Van_der_Sijs_Loanwords_in_the_World's_Languages.pdf) in the World's Languages - A Comparative Handbook", and at page 332 she has combined topic with source language and got some somewhat surprising results. It is not a surprise that 13,8% of all words in her corpus within the field "Modern World"  are English loanwords. The surprise is that this is the only topic where English is a major player (commercials weren't defined as a separate topic). The overall percentages are as follows:

*French 6,8%, Latin 6,1%, High & Low German 2,7%, English 1,5%, Other Romance languages 1,1%, other 0,3%, total loanwords 19,1%, rest 80,9%.*

There is one danger to be considered in this context, namely that you learn the 'easy' loan words and understandable heritage words, but neglect the incomprehensible heritage words. I have seen this tendency with myself and my Romanian, and the obvious solution for me was to do wordlists with this last category alone. For those who only learn words from context it must be harder to address the problem in specific terms. 

The multiple language discount is also relevant for grammatical features. Let's examine a few concrete examples. 

Let's take the Russian word "принадлежать" (pri-nad-lezhatj, 'belong to'):

"при-" as a verbal prefix normally indicates direction towards of position near, "над" as a prefix normally indicates that something happens on top of something, and the homonymous preposition means the same thing or movement towards the space above something. Finally "лежать" means "lie" or "lie down", so the whole things basically means "lie on something (or somebody)". Now the funny thing about Russian is that owning something rarely is expressed with a specific verb (even though there is a verb with a suitable meaning: иметь). Instead the Russian use a combination of "y" and the dative, or in other words: in Russian you don't own thing - they just are near you. And "принадлежать" fits nicely into this logic. A logic you wouldn't have known about without plucking the word to pieces.

This example only involved one language (Russian), but while I learnt the first words in Polish and later in Serbian I regularly used associations involving Russian words, and my personal experience is that without constructing the mesh of associations right from the start I simply don't learn words efficiently.

Let's widen the scope and look for  syntactic examples with more than one language involved. Here the goal isn't to memorize single words, but to understand constructions, which with a bit of luck might help you to internalize them.

Let's start with a simple argument. In English you say "another thing", and in Italian you have an analog construction: "un'altra cosa" - but not so in Spanish: here you drop the article "otra cosa". To learn this just from reading or listening is definitely possible, but if you are an English speaker with some knowledge of Italian who now wants to add Spanish you will be severely tempted to add the article in Spanish. Or even worse: drop it in Italian. My suggestion would be not to rely on subconscious mechanisms, but to make the difference visible and conscious - and maybe even memorize an example which almost can function as its name - like for instance "un'altro - otro".

A slightly more complicated example: ergativity. It is normally seen as something weird and exotic, but in essence it just means that the object of a transitive verb is in the same case as the subject of an intransitive - and then the subject of the transitive verb has to be in something else. Just to illustrate this I'll quote a typical description from the internet (http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/ergative.htm)

*The ergative case is hard to understand because it refers to something not found in English. Generally it has to do with a language having a special indication that the subject in a sentence which has a transitive verb and direct object. If the subject is the agent of the action involved for the transitive verb then there is special marker attached to the noun which is the subject. This puts the noun into the ergative case. For sentences with intransitive verbs the subject is treated grammatically the same as direct objects are treated in sentences with transitive verbs. Few languages have the ergative case feature. The most notable are Basque, Sumerian and Greenlandic.*

*English is not an ergative language and furthermore it does not distinguish between the use of a noun for a subject and for an object. However, personal pronouns in English are generally so distinguished. We say, He kissed her and She kissed him. In English we say He puckered up, but if English were an ergative language we would say Him puckered up. There is a certain logic to this construction in that the phrase Puckered him up, sounds right although unusual. (Somewhat like Star Wars Yoda's syntax.)*

But even Wiktionary.org has noticed that this isn't quite correct: according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_ergative_verbs) English has no less that 322 ergative verbs. Well, English doesn't use cases much anyway, but it has an accusative form of some pronouns, and besides it uses word order to distinguish things:

*They bent me to their will.*  
*The road bends to the right*

This may not be fullblown ergativity, but it can help a learner to understand the logic behind it. 

I'll give one final example which I noticed during the flight home from Budapest after the Polyglot conference  in 2013. I studied the grammar section of Kauderwelsch Band 31, [Ungarisch](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID%20=12983&PN=410) Wort für Wort, and there I noticed a funny pattern:

Hungarian verbs have two paradigms for the present tense, the ordinary one and a definite present which only is used when the direct object is definite (which of course implies that the verb must be transitive). Their endings are quite different, and they are both illustrated with one verb that represents a 'dark' (or 'deep') vowel harmony and another which shows the 'light' (or 'high') vowel harmony. For my purpose it is enough to show one of them, namely the verb "tudni" (to know". First the ordinary present, then the definite one (in the usual order 1,2,3 singularis + 1,2,3 pluralis): 

Ordinary: én tud**ok**, to tud**sz**, ö/ön tud, mi tud**unk**, ti tud**tok**, ön/önök tud**nak**  
Definite: én tud**om**, to tud**od**, ö/ön tud**ja**, mi tud**juk**, ti tud**játok**, ön/önök tud**ják** 

(ön and önök are 'polite' pronouns) 

In a totally different context there is a chapter about something called "Besitzverhältnis" (ownership), which isn't an ordinary genitive. If I say "the man's trousers" then it is the man which has a pair of trousers, not the inverse. That's how a genitive functions. If you say "táskája" in Hungarian (with táská = handbag) then the owner is a third person entity and the handbag is the owned object. So the flexive element is possessive, but not genitival. 

Now take the 'dark' (or 'deep') endings through the usual persons, applied to "táska" by me (the book only gives the endings): 

tásk**ám**, tásk**ád**, tásk**ája**, tásk**ánk**, táská**tok**, tásk**ájuk** 

I may have used a wrong vowel in some places, but the system is clear: here you actually see a substantive with the same endings through number and person as a verbal form, namely those of the definite present. And I'm sure this isn't a coincidence. 

Maybe it is worth pointing out that Hungarian like Russian and Irish doesn't have a simple verb for 'to have' (although they do have verbs that mean 'to own') - instead they all use a formulation like "to me is..." instead of "I have". And they all three have a strong tendency to leave out the forms of 'to be' in the present. Kauderwelsch illustrates the Hungarian construction with this example, where you of course immediately recognize the ending "ja": 

*Péternek - autója van*  
*Peter+dative Auto+sein ist (approx. "forPeter carHis is")*  
*Peter has a car*

What now about the common present and its endings you might ask? The system there is not quite as regular, but almost, and it involves the dative, not the "Besitzverhältnis". In Hungarian the dative of substantives is marked by the endings -nak or -nek (low resp. high). So the interrogative pronoun has the dative "kinek" (nominative "ki", accusative "kit"). And the forms of the personal pronoun are built on "nek". NB: there are separate polite forms so there will be 2 x 4 elements below (1,2,3 and this polite thing - and please notice that there aren't separate genders in the paradigms - the Finno-Ugrian languages don't operate with morphological gender): 

*Nominative: én, te, ö, ön / mi, ti, ök, önök*  
*Accusative: engem, téged, öt, önt / minket, titeket, öket, önöket*  
*Dative: nekem, neked, neki, önnek / nekünk, nektek, nekik, önöknek*

As you can see the positive forms in the accusative and dative are treated as ordinary 'high' substantives, but it is equally clear that there is a remarkable similarity between the endings of the other dative forms of the personal pronoun and the endings of the ordinary present as presented above (apart from 3 p.sing "-i"). And the accusative? Well, the ending of nouns in the accusative is 'something with a t', and you actually see this 't' in all forms except 1. & 2. person singular (where the endings are more like those of the definite present and the dative).

I have not yet learned Hungarian, but as this example shows it may be exotic, but not devoid of logic. In my opinion the best way of internalizing an utterly different grammatical system is first to try to see whether there is some kind of governing logic - and then decide whether there are a small number of things that might be worth learning by heart. And then you can start learning the details in an interplay between grammar and the real world.

There are a number of practical problems with the acquisition and maintenance of multiple languages, like finding time and getting exposure enough, but as you can see there are also benefits - in particular between related languages, where you get a lot of vocabulary and sentence patterns almost for free, just with the obligation to be alert to differences and false friends. 

One irritating problem is that people may ask you how many languages you speak, and if you then say a number they will expect that you speak them all fluently. But in practice it will be a ladder with a number of fluent languages at the top and those you just know theoretically or are able to read at the bottom. The Russian author Spivak wrote in his book "Как стать полиглотом" ('How to become a polyglot') about his '[seven](http://www.e-reading.link/bookreader.php/89669/Spivak_-_Kak_stat%27_poliglotom.html) languages rule' - implying that seven languages (plus/minus one) was the maximal number a human being could keep fluent and ready for use at all times. The rest would then be slightly rusty so that it would need some brushing-up to get them up to speed again. My experience  with this is that this can happen to languages you don't use much, but your passive skills are much less affected by a few weeks or months of inactivity. And if you could establish a situation where you used ten or eleven languages on a daily basis it might be feasible to keep that number of languages kicking and alive - but few of us have that opportunity.
