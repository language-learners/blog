title: 5.9 Activating languages

I have a couple of personal guidelines: 

I call a language intermediate when I can keep on thinking in the language, but with lots of holes and errors. If I'm traveling with a language on this level I can ask for things in shop or make short comments, but I couldn't manage a extended discussion. 

I speak about basic fluency when I can go to a country where the language is spoken and stay there for several days without using other languages, not even when I'm having longer discussions with the local people. I still can't avoid making errors, and I may have a strong accent, but I can have discussions about more or less the same themes as I would have had in for instance English or French or German (though I have to make do with a smaller vocabulary).

I speak about advanced fluency when I am confident (or I'm told by a competent source) that I speak almost correctly, - but not necessarily without an accent. And at this stage I would obviously not let anybody scare me into speaking English or some other tourist language. 

But these definitions only concern one skill, namely speaking the languages (because that's my poorest discipline in each and every language). In fact you should indicate a level for both the active skills: thinking, writing, speaking, and the passive ones: reading, understanding speech. You can in principle be able to read even the weirdest poems in a language and still be unable to ask for an ice cream. 

There are also some more official evaluation systems, such as the one used by the "The Common European Framework" of the European [Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_%20of_Reference_for_Languages). This system divides learners into six levels: 

A Basic User  
. A1 Breakthrough  
. A2 Waystage

B Independent User  
. B1 Threshold  
. B2 Vantage

C Proficient User  
. C1 Effective Operational Proficiency  
. C2 Mastery

The CEFR describes what a learner is supposed to be able to do in reading, listening, speaking and writing at each level. But as every other system of this kind suffers from the defect that it attaches just one level of skill to a person for a given language, but the reality is that you probably are much better at some activities than at others, - for instance my speaking ability will always be the lowest, while writing abilities are more problematic for others (including native speakers). Passive skills will almost always be better than active skills. 

If you have learnt a passive language to a high level you need to have a steady stream of input to keep the language alive. In the case of Latin it means reading Latin on a daily basis. No input, no activity. This reduces your chances of keeping the language alive during a dry spell. Learning a language as an active thing simply makes it more robust because you always can do some thinking in an active language wherever you are. 

The activation of passive languages is precisely the thing I described with my Latin as an example. All the grammar and the words I had learnt in the 70s had in fact hibernated, and when I started to relearn my Latin I didn't have to hammer through everything again from scratch, I just needed some repetition rounds, and then I was ready to start thinking and writing in Latin. The only catch was that I wanted to think about things that didn't exist while Latin was still alive, - for instance this forum, my computer, trains, modern town planning and nuclear physics. So I have been busy modernizing my conception of Latin. But everything I learned about Latin as a passive language have come to good use now where my goal is broader.   (â€¦) 

In retrospect, my first period with Latin was so lopsided because the teaching - as most teaching of Latin - followed an ancient and venerable method called grammar-translation, i.e. an outdated theory where the main goal was to be able to read certain venerable classical authors, but not to be able to use the language. The ironi is that I now have to battle against other theories that dismiss explicit learning of grammar and vocabulary, such as the methods of Krashen and other protagonists of so-called natural learning. 

My current position is that you always should try to develop active skills, even in dead or 'undead' languages like Latin, but of course the consequences of having a 'bad' accent are less obvious if you never have to speak to anybody. With a language like Latin this implies that you should try to find dictionaries and homepages and other sources which try to update Latin. My preferred source for reading in NeoLatin is the web-newspaper Ephemeris (ephemeris.alcuinus.net), and I have found wordlists and dictionaries that make suggestions about words that cover contemporary phenomena. Not only will it be more amusing to spend time on Latin when you see it as a living thing, but all aspects of your Latin knowledge will be more robust. 

Languages or dialects that you can understand because you know something that resembles them falls in another category because it isn't an immense, but fragile skeleton of grammatical rules and passive vocabulary that keeps them accessible for you, but something which you actually use - namely your own language or another language which you know well. However there is a difference between understanding and actually being able to use such a language or dialect - and the consequences of disregarding this distinction can be quite unbearable. 

A good example of this is the relation between the Scandinavian languages. Some outsiders have suggested that they really just are dialects, and the proof is supposed to be that Scandinavians (Danes, Norwegians and Swedes) can understand each other. Well, the reality is that it takes a fair amount of exposure to make that possible, and right now it seems that the intercomprehensibility between the three main Nordic languages is seeping away because English comes in between them. But even a person who can understand practically everything on TV or in magazines in another Nordic language can't just go ahead and speak it. The result will be the persons own language plus some borrowed words and some of the more conspicuous intonations from the other language.

If you want to make a passive language/dialect of this kind active then my advice would be: do the same things as you would do with an unknown language - i.e. supplement your listening and reading with explicit grammar studies, vocabulary acquisition et cetera. The good news is that each phase will last for a much shorter time. 

And that's about what I had to say about language learning for the moment.
