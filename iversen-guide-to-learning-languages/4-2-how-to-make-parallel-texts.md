title: 4.2 How to make parallel texts
author: Iversen
---
In the preceding chapter I have argued that the use of parallel text is a very practical way to deal with texts which objectively seen are above your level in target language. The question is now how to get them. If you have a book in the original and a translation, both on paper, there isn't much you can do about it. I have a notestand near my favorite armchair where I can put one of them, but it is not a convenient solution. If you use Google translate to see a homepage in two different languages - or you find a homepage with the same texts in several languages - then you operate with several windows on your screen, and there are ways make them both visible at the same time. This chapter deals with three methods which can be used for making short bilingual texts on paper - which is the format I use for almost all my intensive text studies.

The first format I used was the **interlinear** format, inspired by language guides and grammatical treatises where a text might be accompanied by a translation in the line below it. Like 

(English) <span style="color:navy">The first format I used ...</span>  
(Danish)  <span style="color:maroon">Det første format jeg brugte ...</span>

I remember that I found a collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen in a number of languages, and I wanted to combine them into one text with alternating languages in alternating lines. So I read to versions in each a window in MS Word and placed one above the other. Then I went through the texts and cut the lines at the same points in the two versions (which only was possible if I already could identify corresponding passages).

<span style="color:navy">I found a collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen</span>  
<span style="color:green">J'ai trouvé une collection de contes de Hans Christian Andersen</span>

<span style="color:navy">in a number of languages, and I wanted to combine them ...</span>  
<span style="color:green">en plusieurs langues, et je voudrais les combiner ...</span>

After that I transferred the two texts to Excel (any spreadsheet would do) and added line numbers and a letter as shown:

And finally I combined the two sets of columns and sorted them as shown below. Problem solved.

Was it worth the effort? No. 

Later on I experimented with Google translate and found a trick that could produce an '**interspersed**' format, similar to the one used by Ilya [Frank](http://english.franklang.ru/):

<span style="color:navy">Dear Friends</span>, <span style="color:purple">Geagte Vriende</span>,  <span style="color:navy">You are now visiting Ilya Frank's site, where you can find books and texts in different languages with their literal translations into English and brief linguistic comments</span>. <span style="color:purple">Jy is nou 'n besoek Ilya Frank se webwerf, waar jy boeke en tekste in verskillende tale met hul letterlike vertalings in Engels en kort taalkundige kommentaar kan vind</span>. 

I let Google Translate do its magick on a homepage, marked a translated text and inserted it 'as text' in Word. By some weird quirk in that program all the comments now became regular parts of the text. But if both languages used the same alphabet the result was confusing so I then had to add colours by hand, sentence by sentence - and that took long time for texts with more than just a few lines. Besides there was a problem with dots after abbreviations and number - Google thought all dots separated sentences, and the result could be rather muddled. 

Was it worth the effort? Definitely not. And when I tried it a moment ago the trick didn't function.

Nowadays I only use a **side by side** approach, where clips in each language are placed in tables in Word or Libre Writer or some other word processor. Original and translation rarely have the same length, but this can be regulated by changing the width of the columns, and the texts can be further finetuned by manipulating the font size or maybe even the choice of font. The translation can be a genuine human- made translation or a machine translation, with or without formatting. And it is very fast to make bilingual texts using this method (source: the Asturian Uiquipedia and my own translation):

In the example above I have deliberately used a translation which has elements that are expressed quite differently from what you saw in the original version (for instance "communitariamente" somehow became the first section of the compound "community project"), and even where the elements are similar their order can be changed. This is typical for human made translations, where the goal of the translator is to make a text that is easy and pleasant to read for people who can't understand with the original version, __not__ to help scholars or language learners who want some help to understand the original. Some translations are more literal than others -  for instance the translators of the Harry Potter books have clearly been instructed not to deviate more than necessary from the original, whereas some other literary translations leave the impression that the translator would have preferred to write his/her own book from scratch.

There are systems on the internet that can be used to make parallel translations of whole books, but it should be clear that copyright reasons often will prevent you from sharing a translation of any kind. 

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/%20wiki/Machine_translation) machine translations have been around since the 50s: 

*In the 1950s Machine translation, (MT), became a reality in research, although references to subject can be found as early as the 17th century. The Georgetown experiment, which successfully involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English in 1954 was one of the earliest recorded projects. Researchers of the Georgetown experiment asserted their beliefs that within three to five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.*

Well, it didn't happen. I haven't studied the methods used by the Georgetown experimentators or other pioneers, but when I was studying languages in the 70s we tacitly expected that functioning machine translation systems - if they ever became reality - would have to be programmed by hand, and that you would need a separate dictionary and a suitable grammar - probably based on some variant of Chomsky's generative grammar, which seemed to be more suitable for machines than for humans.

According to the same source, Google Translate was launched in 2006, and it has now by a wide margin become the dominating system - even to the point that other homepages which claim to offer their own translations actually just tap into Google Translate. Google used a system called Systran for a year or so (and it may still be used by other machine translation systems), but in 2007 it switched to a statistically based system based entirely on comparisons between huge amounts of parallel texts. It is surprising that it has been possible at all, but some persistent errors can be traced back to this technique - like the tendency to substitute capitals, institution names and languages names in a text in a base language with others which have the same role and are more frequent in the target language. The lack of a grammatical analysis also causes other persistent and typical errors, like for instance loss of negations and weird changes in the word order which result in the disruption of nominal paradigms. 

How can I then advocate using such a system to make bilingual texts? Well, for three reasons. 

The first reason is that I don't have an alternative - it is hard enough to find a decent translation of Shakespeare, but try finding a translation of an article from the magazine of the Serbian tuba players' organization. 

The second reason is that human-made translations can be just as disloyal to the original - not because they make more overt translation errors, but because they have a tendency to use expressions that transmit the gist, but not the letter of the original. And sometimes they even add new elements or remove whole passages from the original without any warning. 

The third reason is that I only use Google and its competitors to produce translations <u>into</u> a language I know well - never to produce texts in my target language which I then proceed to study. 

On the internet you can sometimes find a text in a target language which at closer inspection turns out to be machine translations, which barely have been edited before publication. For instance I once found a collection of articles about popular science in Irish - but it didn't take long to notice that the publishers hadn't even bothered to move the verbs to the initial position, where they belong in Irish. Such texts shouldn't be used for any kind of study - they prevent you from acquiring any kind of real feeling for the language in question. 

The other way is a totally different story. In practice a Google translation from ar target language into something you know well can be more useful than a free human-made translation, both because its most glaring errors are clearly visible and because you only use it to clear up murky points in the original. The quality of the translation depends on the size of the language -  the more texts Goggle has had to analyze, the higher the chance that it settled for correct translations. 

The worst case by far of those I have been able to try myself has been Latin, where the lack of a comprehensive modern bilingual text base AND the free word order of the source language have combined to make translations that would be an abomination even if they were produced by a  newbee learner. The translations from Dutch have also sometimes surprised me -. which is harder to understand. After all a language with around twenty million native speakers should have produced a sufficiently large amount of parallel text for analysis by the software used by Google. But to be fair, I have also seen many absolutely correct translations, and Google adds new language faster than I can learn them. 

Let's finally have a look at a concrete example, a quote from the bilingual in-flight magazine "Elevate" of Air Serbia, October 2014, with a Google translation:

Serbian: <span style="color:maroon">U "rajski vrt" u kome se biljke uzgajaju biodinamičkim putem, ulazi se samo u tačno određeno vreme - biljke i pčele se ne smeju uznemiravati!</span>

English: <span style="color:navy">Visitors can only enter the "Garden of Eden", where plants are grown through biodynamic agriculture, at scheduled times - plants and bees mustn't be disturbed!</span>

Google T: <span style="color:blue">In the "Garden of Eden" in which plants are grown bio-dynamic way, enters only at specific time - the plants and the bees must not disturb!</span>

As you can see, the Google Translate translation lacks a subject for "enters" and interprets "se ne smeju uznemiravati" (disturb) as an active construction, where the English version from the magazine correctly assigns a passive meaning to this construction. But if you were a struggling language learner, which version would help you most?
