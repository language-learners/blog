title: 5.6 Automatizing your target language
author: Iversen

One goal of your language learning is to make the cumbersome construction (or decoding) of utterances automatic. In a HTLAL thread from 2010 member Cainntear wrote: 

*As an absolute beginner in language (French) I had to think things out -- I relied on conscious knowledge to construct the sentence. After a while, I started to notice that while I was thinking about how to form the correct sentence, there was a fully formed sentence appearing in parallel. It seemed like that voice had been there for a while, but I was just thinking too hard to notice it..*

This is a very interesting statement, and one I can recognize from myself - but in a weak language I would have single words and sticks-and-boxes fleating around in my mind before the complete sentence pops up. I don't feel that there is a sharp border between those fragments and the final fullyfledged sentence - they belong to the same process that produced it.

I have written about intensive and extensive strategies and activities again and again, mostly - but not exclusively - in the realm of passive learning. And I have stated that intensive activities are most important in the beginning, whereas the scales tip more and more in the favor of extensive activities the further you progress in your learning process. And the reason that this happens is mainly that more and more of the knowledge you get through intensive activities is covered by automatic and even subconscious mechanisms. 

One example of this is that you don't have to run through a conjugation table to find an ending and construct a certain form of a word - you have seen this form so often that this particular form is stored as an individual item. Other examples are the influence of one sound on surrounding sounds, the choice of preposition after a noun or verb and the choice of case after a preposition. But even though these individualized reflexes are the end goal they don't have to be absorbed as single items, which would last forever. Tables and list of rules are there to show you where all those scattered pieces of information belong. 

An interesting development has been that the two storage mechanisms - as indivisible items and as computational objects - have been studied at the neurophysiological level, for instance in a study " How the brain processes complex words: an event-related potential study of German verb inflections" by Penke [et al.](http://www.genlingnw.ru/Staff/Psycholinguistics/How.pdf) where complex words were studied by presenting German native speakers with deliberately erroneous forms. Quote:

*We  conclude  that  two  complementary mechanisms co-exist in how our brain processes morphologically complex words:   i.  accessing  full-form  entries  stored  in  memory; and  ii.  a computational system that decomposes complex words  into  stems  and  affixes.  This  distinction is  reflected in different ERP responses to i and ii.*

On the other there are also studies that point to a stronger role for whole-form retrieval  ("Neurophysiological evidence for whole form retrieval of complex derived words: a mismatch negativity study" by [Hanna](http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/v/brainlang/publications%20/2014/2014_Hanna_ProvisionalPDF.pdf?1414403135) & Pulvermüller).

*We found that congruent derived words elicited a  stronger MMN than incongruent derived words, about 150 milliseconds af ter perception of the critical morpheme. This pattern of results is consistent with whole-form storage of morphologically complex derived words as lexical units, or mini-constructions. (..)  In addition, neurophysiological results reflected the frequency of derived forms, thus providing further converging evidence for whole form storage and against a combinatorial mechanism.*

But remember: these studies have tested native speakers. They don't say that newbee language learners can or should learn all word forms as individual indivisible units - including the complex ones. It should however be seen as a sign of progress if you can stop forming complex words on the fly and instead retrieve them as fullyfledged entities. For once the learning process may profit from another process type than the one you expect to use at the end of the day.

The special situation for learners is described in a number of papers, for instance " Second language learners’ processing of inflected words:" by [Hahne](http://endeavour.essex.ac.uk/141/1/errl_45a.pdf) & Müller:

*Two different subsystems of German inflection were studied, participial inflection and noun plurals. For participial forms, L2 learners were found to widely generalize the -t suffixation rule in a nonce-word elicitation task, and in the ERP experiment they showed an anterior negativity followed by a P600 – both results resembling previous findings from native speakers of German on the same materials. For plural formation, the L2 learners displayed different preference patterns for regular and irregular forms in an off-line plural judgment task. Regular and irregular plural forms also differed clearly with regard to their brain responses.*

In other words: this is a fairly complex question, but the brains of learners of German do show some consistent differences in the way the brain reacts to erroneous forms. I think we'll have to leave the question there, but there will definitely be more research in brain patterns in the coming years. Right now the field seems to be in an earlier stage where the reports still conflict.

In the beginning of a language study there is basically only one active extensive activity available for you: parroting. You can hear an expression (in a situation where you can guess the meaning), and then you repeat it. Actually you don't even need you left brain with its language centers for this - the right brain can store this kind of unreflected fragments. The intensive language production starts already when you make the first minimal change - you have to know something about the mechanism of the phrase to make that change. And unless you continue along the parrot trail most or your active language production will consist of constructed utterances for a very long time. 

But lo and behold, at a certain point you may experience that some little gnomon in the back of your mind starts making sentences on his/her own, and then you can start your extensive language production career. Your language production has become partly automatized. The problem is that this is more likely to happen if you do a lot of language production the hard way first. For those of us who rarely speak in foreign languages at home this can partly be solved through silent thinking and (for the more energetic ones) by speaking to yourself - I remember an excellent advice about pretending that you speak into a mobile phone, if you are to shy to walk around speaking to nobody in public. However I personally mostly stick to silent thinking. 

Nevertheless I have found one trick that might be worth exploiting for others: I listen to something on TV or on the internet in a language I know fairly well, and then I make a simultaneous translation to a related weak language on the fly. Of course it will be totally rubbish in the beginning, but just having to hammer through something like a translation at the speed of a native speaker will mean that I don't have time to construct anything - and then the little lurking gnomon has the chance to appear without any interference from my internal schoolmaster. 

And with time the little fellah may even be able to speak in somewhat sounding like the real thing - but only because the systematic part of me constantly feeds him with information about the language in question. 

And no, I don't feel like a victim of multiple personality disorder.
