title: 4.3 Hyperliteral translations
author: Iversen

Hyperliteral translations are translations from language A to language B that try to stick to the words and the constructions of language A, even when this means that the result in language B isn't grammatical and in some cases not even meaningful when judged with the standards of language B. 

It is a known fact that languages aren't parallel. If you say that "cheval" in French is a translation of "horse" in English, then it just means that both refer to a certain fourlegged mammal. However there may be cases where 'cheval' in French doesn't correspond to 'horse' in English. Take for instance the expression "être très à cheval sur quelqu'un" = "to be strict with someone", "be a stickler with someone". Often these derived meanings have some connection with the 'core meaning' (in this case the fourlegged animal, - to be strict with someone is almost as sitting on them as on a horse), but some words don't even have a single dominating core meaning, and then there is no reason to expect that their meaning(s) can be covered by one single word in another language. 

This situation is also found with grammatical constructions. For instance many languages have reflexive pronouns, i.e. pronouns that by definition refer back to an explicit or implied subject. In Danish "tage sin hat" means 'take the speaker's own hat' (reflexive "sin"), while "tage hendes hat" means 'take her hat', i.e. some other (female) person's hat. In English there aren't unstressed reflexive pronouns so the context will dictate the meaning in a concrete sentence. (PS: in this case I have decided to write a generic reflexive 'self', just as in Old English) 

Ordinary translations systematically try to cover up these problems by reformulating phrases or guessing at the intended meaning and choosing one out of several possible interpretations. Depending on the skill and ambitions of the translator this can mean that the general meaning is preserved, but all direct parallels between the original and the translation are lost. This can be a problem for a language learner who wants to understand the role of each element in the original version. A hyperliteral translation has no literary pretensions at all, but tries to 'imitate' the original version at all levels. 

So "être très à cheval sur quelqu'un" would in a hyperliteral translation be something like "(to) be very on horse on someone", and you would add a corresponding idiomatic expression in language B if the meaning can't be guessed ('be a stickler'). However even this version isn't a perfect hyperliteral translation: the 'to' is normally necessary in English, while the French infinitive can stand alone, - therefore the word 'to' is put between parentheses. Even this simple example shows that there is some judgment involved in making a hyperliteral translation, just as in making an ordinary 'literary' translation. When explaining exotic constructions in remote languages you may even have to add morphological markers in some places. This has to be decided in the concrete case. 

Hyperliteral translations in combination with 'normal' translations have been used in some language guides, such as the German series Kauderwelsch and the French language guides from Assimil. An example from Kauderwelsch 90 Irisch-Gälisch p.85:

(in English: Would-be good with-you cup tea? Is! better with-me coffee)

The second line is the pronunciation, the third is the German hyperliteral translation. and the fourth line contains the expression a native German  would have used. And that's exactly the problem with 'free' translations: they tell you what a speaker of your own language would have said, not what the foreign speaker actually said (or wrote). But part of learning a foreign language is to know what  native speakers REALLY say, and what the logic in their constructions and expression REALLY is. 

Hyperliteral translations are also commonly used in scientific articles and books, especially those that deal with  grammatical  questions.  Below you see a couple of examples from  "A [survey](http://ogma.newcastle.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/uon:834) of relative pronouns and their uses in natural and artificial languages" by Libert, Alan;  Moskovsky and Christo: 

![Two examples of hyperliteral translations of short phrases with a relative clause involving a noun and an active participle, in Finnish and German.](../4-3-image-2.jpg)

In some cases  a simple rendering in words isn't sufficient, and then you can add symbols to indicate things like case, gender, role in the sentence or distinctions that don't even exist in the target language. Let's se another example from the same article, this time from Russian: 

![Example of a relative clause in Russian, with a noun and pronoun fully described for case, person-number morphology and gender.](../4-3-image-3.jpg)

Line 1 and 3 contain the transliterated version of the Russian text (мужчина, с которым я вчера познакомился), and the hyperliteral translation in line 2 and 4 runs like this: "the man-NOM-3SG-MASC with who-DAT-3SG-MASC I yesterday got-acquainted". It is clear that too many details make the translation almost illegible, but the added informations in the quote are actually all embedded in the endings of the Russian words, and they represent the information you have to be able to extract from the Russian original to understand it. 

I would like to mention one concrete case more, which I had to deal with myself. In Irish the verbs are placed at the beginning of the sentences, and normally only conjunctions, a few verbal particles and interrogative pronouns can precede them (except in some constructions with a copula verb). But inversion is used for interrogative sentences in most of my languages, so in the beginning the Irish word order irritated me. So I got the idea to put an exclamation sign after the verb to 'neutralize' the interrogative effect - but only until I had become accustomed to the weird ways of the Irish: 

*"Oro, sé do bheatha a bhaile, is fearr liom tu ná céad bo bain(ne)" ---> (Wikipedia:) Oro, welcome home, I would rather have you than a hundred milch cows ---> (me:) ..is**<span style="color:red">!</span>** better with me than hundred milk cows*

(see also the discussion at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3A%C3%93r%C3%B3_s%C3%A9_do_bheatha_abhaile))
 
It is clear that hyperliteral translations only should be used in the early stages of learning a new language. They are much better than ordinary translations to convey the structure of the phrases in the original language, but as soon as you can understand the general meaning of spoken and written texts in language A the best strategy would normally be not to make or use translations at all, except when you look up unknown words or idiomatic phrases in dictionaries and other sources. From that moment on translations would primarily be done for the benefit of others, and then it is logical to try to make translations from language A that are please your costumers, even though they from a strictly linguistical point of view are misleading.
