*This section begins the Fifth part - How to deal with speech and writing.*

It would be absurd to discuss listening without taking ProfArguelles' Shadowing method into consideration. Among the first references to it in the HTLAL forum is the following one from 2005.

Let us define: 

Echoing = listen, then repeat  
Shadowing = listen and repeat simultaneously 

I believe that echoing can be an invaluable technique when you are working one on one with a phonetician who can correct your pronunciation and intonation. However, when you are working on your own, you really have no way of determining the accuracy of your rendition. When you shadow through earphones, however, you should at least instinctively and immediately perceive when you are "flat," and with constant repetition of the same material, you will begin to automatically compensate by modifying your pronunciation. 

Three years (10 March 2008) later he made a video, and in the introduction to this video he wrote these lines: 

In order to shadow most effectively, it is important to observe three points: 

1. Walk outdoors as swiftly as possible. 
2. Maintain perfectly upright posture. 
3. Articulate thoroughly in a loud, clear voice. 

(....) 

In the video, you see me initially shadowing without looking at a book, then while looking at one. You will want to shadow without a book when you are in the very initial stages of language study, focusing on phonetics only (= “blind shadowing”), before you study any individual lesson, and then again finally after you have worked through your lessons thoroughly. 

In one of his videos on accent formation he explicitly states that shadowing gives much better results than echoing. Nevertheless echoing is the technique that is used not only in classrooms all over the planet, but also in the kind of language labs I remember from my study. 

Unfortunately the method didn't function for me - I simply stopped listening while I spoke (so I'll never become a good simultaneous interpreter).

Chorusing would normally be done in a class room setting with a teacher. Chorusing would normally be done in a class room setting with a teacher. In a discussion on HTLAL someone mentioned the Swede Olle Kjellin, and he not only participated in person in the discussion, but gave also some references to literature about accent reduction techniques, including the article "The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance" by Erickson, Krampe and Tesch-Roemer, which also tells about the changing views through history on the concept of training. Let's first quote some general remarks about training:

*There is a relatively widespread conception that if individuals are innately talented, they can easily and rapidly achieve an exceptional level of performance once they have acquired basic skills and knowledge. Biographical material disproves this notion. In their classic study of expertise in chess, Simon and Chase (1973) observed that nobody had attained the level of an international chess master (grandmaster) "with less than about a decade's intense preparation with the game" (p. 402). Simon and Chase estimated that the amount of knowledge a chess master has acquired is comparable in size to the vocabulary of an adult native speaker of English. It takes normal individuals approximately a decade to acquire this vocabulary (...)*

The article briefly mentions the role of feedback:

*Studies focusing on speed of performance tend to use easy tasks, where highly accurate performance is rapidly attained, and subjects are instructed to increase the speed of performance while maintaining the high level of accuracy. Under these conditions subjects' performance improves monotonically as a function of the amount of practice according to the power law (...) In the absence of adequate feedback, efficient learning is impossible and improvement only minimal even for highly motivated subjects. Hence mere repetition of an activity will not automatically lead to improvement in, especially, accuracy of performance (..).*

.. but then also points out a flaw in some of the research:

*When laboratory training is extended over longer time periods, studies show that providing a motivated individual with repeated exposure to a task does not ensure that the highest levels of performance will be attained. Assessment of subjects' methods shows that inadequate strategies often account for the lack of improvement. (...)*

In the HTLAL thread I wrote the following:

*As language learners we can essentially try to absorb an humungous amount of unrelated pieces of grammatical information, or we can try to find patterns. And it seems logical to try the same thing with phonetics. You shouldn't primarily spend time on teaching people how to pronounce specific words, but rather go for series of words that point to some general problem - which for instance could be that all /i/ sounds are too flat, or that some ending shouldn't be pronounced clearly unless you are spelling the word out to a foreigner.*

*Unfortunately that's difficult to do in a group setting. As a teacher in that situation you have to send out a cloud of informations, which may or may not be relevant for any specific pupil. And as a result of hearing so much irrelevant noise they don't get the advice which would be relevant for them personally. And just letting them hear some excelent native speech can't garantee that they pick up what they themselves make differently.*

*Teaching languages in a group setting is as dangerous as operating patients by throwing knives and scalpels around the operating theater in the hope that they hit someone in just the right spot. I am not sure pronouncing nothing but my own address in Danish (or for that matter Swedish) could keep me attentive and responsive for a whole week, but I'm fairly sure that 1 hour used intelligently is better than 10 spent without aim and purpose in the company of 9 random and uninterested co-students.*

And Kjellin answered as follows:

*I can't agree less, having experience of both teaching and operating! :) The target pronunciation is the same for everyone, the tools for attaining it (the speech apparatus) is the same for everyone, the effect of listening to one another's road to success can't be underestimated, etc. This is an effective listening practice, where they learn to detect the "center of gravity", as it were, for when the pronunciation is "correct", and when it deviates too far. Actually, "correct" pronunciation is \*never\* a point, as in IPA, but more like electron clouds of allophones with statistical centers for each phoneme. Just like any quality control procedure with specified tolerance ranges. During the process, they practice a zillion times to also get that electron cloud feeling motorically through what I call the "audio-motor memory", which will enable them to monitor their own speech and compensate for various external factors just as native speakers can do; so-called compensatory articulation. Which is automatic and subconscious for natives, but rather non-existent for L2 learners having suffered ordinary language classes with minimal pronunciation practice.*

*In my 4 decades of experience, chorus practice alternating with individual exercises in groups of 8 people or more outperformes one-to-one instruction by several orders of magnitude. Also it puts less strain on the teacher and students, so we can do it all day without fatigue.*  
*Quite magically, 7 or less is too few. It's a clear step function at 8. (Indeed, I was told the same thing by amateur choir singers - when they meet to sing and are fewer than 8, it's less fun.)*

Unfortunately that's where I quietly leave through the backdoor. Even if it may be possible to move the pronunciations of a group in the right direction through a massive collective effort it's something I wouldn't want to experience.
