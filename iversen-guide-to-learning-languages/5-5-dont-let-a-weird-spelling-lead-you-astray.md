title: 5.5 Don't let a weird spelling lead you astray

Partly quoted from the thread "[Early](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=37920) Modern English" at HTLAL - which may explain the choice of reference texts.

The Anglosaxon poem Beowulf can't be read without some study of Anglo-Saxon even when using a bilingual edition. But the Pearl poet? I didn't know this author so I had to look him up, and luckily Wikiquote had the Pearl poem with a translation by Brian Stone (http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pearl_Poet). And frankly, I can't see why this stuff in Middle English should be a problem for advanced learners and even less for native speakers. Sometimes you have to think creatively to understand a word, but with the help of the translation you can make decent guesses. Let's have a look at the 1st verse: 

<span style="color:navy">*Allas! I leste hyr in on erbere;*  
*Þurз gresse to grounde hit fro me yot.*  
*I dewyne, fordolked of luf-daungere*  
*Of þat pryuy perle wythouten spot.*</span>

*Alas! In a garden I lost it, let*  
*It go to the ground on a grassy plot.*  
*Bereft of love, I am racked by regret*  
*For Pearl, my own Pearl without a spot.*

The letter Þ (still found in Icelandic) is the same as "th" (which again is the real culprit behind the "y" of "Ye olde shoppe" and similar aberrations). If you didn't know it you should be able to guess it when you reach "þat" ('that'). "leste" is one wowel away from "lost", but this is just another dialect from another time - so look out for other cases where "o" is rendered as "e" by the pearl poet. "erbere": think 'herbal'. "Þurз" may not be the same word as 'turf' (as in 'home turf'), but pretend that it is, and "gresse" looks distinctly like "grassy" (again with an 'e' in place of something else, - now you should almost be able to imagine how this dialect sounded! - something like /wek wek wek/). 

I won't go through the whole thing, but with a translation anybody who can cope with Shakespeare should also be able to understand this poem, and once you have conquered one poem like this one you are ready to tackle other writings from the 14. century, with or without a translation. There will probably be a number of unknown words in them, and once in a while you may even suspect that something more is going on than a simple translation can render. Am I the only one to see a saucy reference in the last stanza? 

"<span style="color:navy">*Moteleз may so meke and mylde",*  
*Þen sayde I to þat lufly flor,*  
*"Bryng me to þat bygly bylde*  
*And let me se þy blysful bor."*  
*Þat schene sayde: "Þat God wyl schylde;*  
*Þou may not enter wythinne hys tor.*</span>" 

*"Moteless maiden so meek and mild,"*  
*Then said I to that fairest flower,*  
*Bring me to that bountiful pile*  
*And let me see your blissful bower."*  
*"God will forbid it," the bright one said.*  
*"You shall not enter his holy place."*

Or in modern language: Poet: May I *** you? Fair maid's answer: Nope! 

Well, maybe my timid ventures into the world of Anglo-Saxon, my mediocre knowledge of Old Norse plus rudiments of Icelandic, French and Latin plus ample, but not recent reading of works by people like Chaucer and Shakespeare has given me a background which makes the Pearl seem almost understandable. But I have to accept the statements from two competent HTLAL members: the Pearl may be just one step beyond comprehensible even for smart native speakers. 

But what is there to do about this? Short of following courses in Early Middle English there may be one trick you could try. I have sometimes read texts in dialects or languages related to something I already knew, and then it helped to try to see through the spelling and just listen to the words in your mind. As I said this poem has often an e (probably open) instead of a and o, which I irreverently rendered as wek-wek-wek. Imagine that you close your nostrils and try to sound slightly tired, detached and ironical - then I think the accent will be there. And then listen to the poem while you read the letters. Then the spelling "gresse" won't lead you astray - you'll hear 'grassy'. The unknown words will of course pose a problem, but there the translation should help you out - although this is a typical literary translation - with all the vagaries this entails - and not a hyperliteral one. But even with this caveat you should have less problems understanding the poem than when you just looked at the aberrant spelling and said: "no way, this is not my kind of English". And now let's leave English, past and present.

Major languages mostly have a standardized spelling, but you can't count on that for dialects or marginalized languages. Sometimes there is a spelling system which have become an unofficial standard. For Low German it is the one defined by Sass (which also is the one used at the low German Wikipedia), and I have a small dictionary in that orthography. But even within that dictionary there are often three for more variants, that illustrate the pronunciations of different (sub)dialects: 

![Entry for befestigen in a Low German dictionary. The word "anslaan" is given the pronunciation variants "ansloon" and "anslagen".](../5-5-image.jpg)

To add to the confusion there are also other standards, and one of these is used in the "Neues hochdeutsch-plattdeutsches Wörterbuch", where the translation of "befestigen" is given as "fastmåken, anmåken". To boot there as dialects or languages close to Platt, but yet not really the same thing - as the Plautdietsch, or Mennonite Low German, which according to Wikipedia originally was "a Low Prussian variety of East Low German, with Dutch influence, that developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Vistula delta area of Royal Prussia (...)". Later it was carried by immigrants to the Americas, where there also are colonies of emigrants speaking other kinds of German. Now how do you survive studying something that is so heterogene? The key here is to learn enough to give you a reasonably stable 'inner voice'. It is not strictly important that it is correct in the sense that at least one native speaker speaks like that, but it must be reasonably stable, and it will probably based on the variants you hear most often . And then you try to apply that voice even to texts in other orthographic systems than the one you are most familiar with. If a passage written in a special orthography then sounds like something you have heard before, chances are that it is. 

On the other hand: if you *are* familiar with the pronunciation of a certain dialect, and you know someone who speaks it as a native speaker, then try to image that you hear that person read the text aloud. You may be able to understand the sounds you hear in your head when they 'come' from some known person.
