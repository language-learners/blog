title: 2.5 Memorization through controlled repetition
author: Iversen
---
For me the use of associations is one of the two main pillars of memorization. The other pillar is repetition. You can choose to rely on chance to produce multiple returns of rare words, but as we have seen are most words so rare that you can read thousands of pages without seeing them more than once. And if that's true for words, it is even more true for expressions.

But authors have sometimes pet words, and then you can meet the same rare word 10 times on a page. You can also choose books and films about subjects where certain types of words are more likely to occur, like culinary terms in cookery books. If you still don't feel that this is enough to give you the large vocabulary described in chapter 4.1 you can try one of the formalized vocabulary learning methods in this chapter. The common element in all these methods is that they in some way try to manipulate the repetitions of words or expressions in ways that are expected to lead to successful memorization. But they are not supposed also to activate the words you learn, that's not their job. The only way to activate words is actually to use your target language. And finding ways to do this can be even more challenging than finding ways to extend your passive vocabulary.

One traditional technique is the use of  flashcards. Such cards are small pieces of paper which you  keep in a small box. They can be two-sided or one-sided. Each two-sided card has a translation or other clue on the front and the corresponding foreign word or expression on the backside, sometimes with an example or other information. You take the first card inside the box and look at it. If you know the word you can put it aside, and if not you turn it and read the explanation, and after that the card is placed behind all other cards of the box. With  one-sided cards you look at for front side and subjectively judge whether you know the word you see - which obviously is MUCH easier than providing the word on the back of a two-sided card. But in both systems the period between each exposure to the card depends both on the time you spend on the task and on the size of the 'deck'. This is a crude way of making certain that all cards are reviewed once in a while, but it was fairly popular before we got all those electronical gadgets. 

As Michel Erard discovered while doing research for his book about hyperpolyglots ("Babel no more"): even the great Cardinal Mezzofanti used flashcards. But today we have other and more sophisticated ways to achieve that, insofar that Anki and other SRS systems can be seen as the digital successors to the venerable flashcard box. SRS means "spaced repetition system", and this refers to the way the time interval between the successive confrontations with a given card is manipulated. The theoretical foundation for this goes back to the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, who spent most of his life studying not how to remember, but how to forget - with himself as guinea pig. Wikipedia writes:

*[Ebbinghaus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) would memorize a list of items until perfect recall and then would not access the list until he could no longer recall any of its items. He then would relearn the list, and compare the new learning curve to the learning curve of his previous memorization of the list. The second list was generally memorized faster, and this difference between the two learning curves is what Ebbinghaus called "savings".*

![Graph plotting the forgetting curve.](../2-5-image-1.jpg)

The graph (from Wikipedia) shows intervals of 1 day on the horizontal axis. Strictly speaking only the red curve represents the forgetting curve of Ebbinghaus. The green curves reflect a process where relearning is started regularly at 1 days intervals, and as you can see the forgetting process runs slower after each repetition. After a number of repetitions it lies almost flat, indicating that the items now for all practical purposes have been stored in your longterm memory. If you draw a horizontal line through the grey vertical lines then it will meet the curves at longer and longer intervals, and that is actually the point of the SRS methods: instead of presenting the material at regular intervals (for instance once per day) you present it again and again with longer and longer time between the repetitions. As if you bumped it each time your recall came below a certain treshold. 

Now this explanation doesn't actually deal with single items - it is more like a statistical claim referring to a lot of similar items. But if you introduce the concept of graduations of recall then the idea also functions with single items. It is then not a question of recalling a word perfectly or not at all, but of recalling it more or less well. 

The following glowing tribute to Supermemo actually comes from a competitor, namely the Anki [manual](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#spaced-repetition):

*The biggest developments in the last 30 years have come from the authors of SuperMemo, a commercial flashcard program that implements spaced repetition. SuperMemo pioneered the concept of a system that keeps track of the ideal time to review material and optimizes itself based on the performance of the user. (...) In SuperMemo’s spaced repetition system, every time you answer a question, you tell the program how well you were able to remember it – whether you forgot completely, made a small mistake, remembered with trouble, remembered easily, etc. The program uses this feedback to decide the optimal time to show you the question again. Since a memory gets stronger each time you successfully recall it, the time between reviews gets bigger and bigger – so you may see a question for the first time, then 3 days later, 15 days later, 45 days later, and so on.*

I don't personally use SRS programs, but I can see that Anki has become the most popular SRS program among forum members, and it has the elements mentioned above, including the choice between different recall levels. The basic idea is that you feed the program with something akin to virtual flashcards, and the machine chooses when you see each individual card again by applying some kind of mathematical algorithm. If you indicate that you don't remember a word at all you will see it again soon, whereas if you claim to remember it really well the next repetition may be scheduled for once in a blue moon. Which is logical. You can make 'cards' with just a target language word and its translation, or you can make more elaborate 'backsides' with example sentences. You can even download complete sets made by others, but that is a problematic feature because you then don't have any influence on which words are in the set, and you didn't get the first round of exposure which normally would contribute to establishing a word in your memory. Another problem is that you may end up with so many cards that you can't possibly keep up with the scheduled  review periods - and then reviewing may become a burden rather than an agreeable session with your favorite hobby. In that case the logical solution is to throw most of the cards out.

My own main reason for not using the system is that I don't like the concept, which is that the machine pokes a card into your face and demands an explanation - like if you were being interrogated by the KGB or you had got a temporary employment as assistant for the knife thrower in a circus. Actually that is also your situation when you read any arbitrary text, but there you can at least enjoy the context, and you may even have chosen the text yourself. The actual learning with Anki only occurs during the shock face after you have been confronted with a card and have to admit that you have forgotten that particular card. It may work, but I prefer wordlists. 

OK, what about wordlists?

We have probably all used a standard text book with short texts and a wordlist in each lesson containing the new words (and sometimes expressions) in that text. What did you do to learn the words in that list? You had a context in the form of a text, but the goal was not to help you translate one specific text, but to teach you a word for later use. I went through many school years and on top of that several years at the university, and to the best of my knowledge I didn't receive any tips about list memorization, apart from suggested associations for specific words. But basically you would use all the memorization tricks mentioned in the preceding chapter, including crude repetition. 

I have reserved the following chapter for my own wordlist setup, but there is one serious contender for a more sophisticated use of wordlists, namely David James' Goldlist system. David James may be more known under his pseudonyms Huliganov and Uncle Davey, but his main contribution to language teaching apart from the goldlists is an immense course in Russian in the form of videoclips on Youtube.

If you really want to learn more about goldlists you should go to the David James' [own](http://huliganov.tv/goldlist-eu/) homepage, where the method is described in detail. Here you'll only get a rough sketch. Basically you choose 25 words and spend 20 minutes on writing them down with a translation and relevant grammatical details in a (quote) *"beautiful hardback book"* with ample free space. You should also read the list aloud. You can do several such sets in one day, but not more than 10 in a row. After at least 2 weeks, but less than 2 months (where you don't even touch the lists) you do a first distillation, i.e. you copy the list minus a third of the words to a new list in the same book. This is called a distillation. What about the words you leave out? Well, David James writes:

*Note that we tend to lose and spend time looking for things which we intended to keep and often put in a special hiding place, but we rarely forget the things that we have thrown away or given away. We don’t usually think we still have them and look around for them. So the very conscious act of discarding tricks the subconscious memory, namely the long-term memory, into being sure it jolly well has got those discarded bits. So if in doubt, discard rather than merge, when distilling.*

Or in other words, the fear of loosing the discarded words will make you remember them. You do this at least two times more, and each time you discard a 30%  of the words. You can use a circular layout, starting in the uppermost left corner, so that all the lists are visible at once, but you are not supposed to refer back to the discarded words. And after the 3 distillations you can copy the few remaining words to a new book and include them in a new cycle.

Now the big question is: does it work? And as with other methods it may work for some persons and not for others. 

Sadly I belong to the second category, and I think I know why. I made an experiment with four sets of 25 Russian words each, and as a control I made one of my own wordlists with 100 other Russian words plus a reference with 100 words which I just left untouched. The illustration to the right is one of my goldlists after the second distillation, but I also did a control round on all three systems after 1½ months. And it turned out that I remembered about two thirds of my 'own' words, but only a third of those from the four goldlists - almost exactly the same ratio as I got with the 100 words I hadn't seen for a more than a month. 

![Samples of Iversen's Russian goldlists.](../2-5-image-2.jpg)

I'm fairly sure this fiasco is a result of the first two directives in James' blog:

*1\. No reliance on mnemonics and no creation of strange methods to try and “visualise” words in contexts. No “think of a cat in a cot and you’ll remember that Polish for ‘cat’ is ‘cot’ “. – These are the ways by the way that course makers like Daniels gets phenomenal results over two weeks but they never last. Just as well, if they did, they would create a learner who, when he came to fluency, would not be able to say “kot” without thinking about a baby’s bed. Ridiculous. Oszustwo. Don’t let the oszusty deceive you by filling your shoes with the letter O at tea time.*

*2\. No cramming, no learning against the clock. No learning for next week, or for tomorrow, or for a test, or for an exam. No conscious “memorizing”. The long-term memory is not a conscious function. Its samples are taken automatically and subconsciously out of the material which is run through the conscious.*

When I tell my brain not to make associations it is tantamount to telling it to forget the stuff I'm looking at. And telling it not to memorize consciously just put the last nail into the coffin. I have thought about doing a set of goldlists where I consciously use mnemonics ('memory hooks') to remember memorize the words in the lists, but it wouldn't be the goldlist method then. However I'm about the worst test person in the world for an experiment like this because I have spent thousands of hours doing wordlists according to my own receipt, which is built on almost the opposite set of ideas. So I would just suggest that you try several techniques and see what works for YOU.
