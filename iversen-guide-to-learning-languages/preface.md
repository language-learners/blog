This guide was originally published in the form of five threads at the language learning forum [HTLAL](http://www.how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum), which I compiled in September 2009 based on discussions in which I had participated since 2006. I made a thorough revision in January-Frebruary 2015 and then one more here in January 2016,  so the version you are reading now is the third one in the row (adapted for this forum). By and large the guide still has the fivepart structure which I gave it in 2009 after just three years of HTLAL, but now divided into chapters rather than messages - which of course can't be seen now that I have started out returning it to forum format. 

The original version is still accessible at HTLAL in its original form (with a few later additions), but after 6 year there were just too many passages that needed a brush-up, and it was also about time to loosen its ties to any specific forum.

And let's just get through a few essential disclaimers before proceeding to the actual guide. This is NOT a scientific treatise about language learning, and its main purpose is NOT to review previous theories on the subject, and you WON'T find a long literature list at the end. I actually do have a scientific background as a cand.mag. in French and Literature from Aarhus University in Denmark, but when I received my final papers in January 1982 I soon realized that the good jobs in the foreign language sector at the university level were occupied by people who couldn't  be expected to leave them soon, and I also realized that the sector for foreign languages at the university level would be shrinking in the years to come. So at that point I took the radical decision to drop all involvement with language studies and language learning apart from casual reading and listening and the use of some, but not all of my languages during travels. And this also meant a final goodbye to doing hardcore science myself (and easy access to a lot of good scientific resources), but not to the mentality which lies behind good science.

When I took up language learning again in 2007 it was as a fanatically independent home learner. Being without access to costly peer reviewed magazines or research libraries I have mostly relied on the internet, and the majority of the scientific writings I have seen on the internet only deal with teacher directed learning. The commercial systems had far too many shortcomings to be used alone, so instead of just choosing one of these and try to be happy with my choice I decided to forge my own set of learning methods based on my former experiences and those things in the scholarly articles which *could* be turned into practical learning tools. References and links from other forum members and bloggers on the internet was a really important aid when it came to localizing such articles, but most of what I write below has been based on my own experiments, and I *may* not be a typical language learner.

Use the guide at your own risk.
