title: 3.2 Morphology in general
author: Iversen

So just call me old-fashioned, but I'll start out with some words about morphology - just as any old grammar did before Chomsky. Actually there is one layer below it, the phonemic layer, but grammar starts where meaning starts.  And now I have made myself unpopular not only with those transformationalists who see meaning as an element you add late in the process, but also with those traditionalists who state that endings and other flective elements don't have a meaning in themselves. Nonsense - if I add a plural 's' to an English noun there suddenly are more than one of whatever that substantive refers to. That's change in the meaning. Or if I insert an apostrophe before the 's' to mark that its a genitive marker, that entity suddenly 'owns' something - well maybe in some figurate sense, but that doesn't matter - the apostrophe still provoked a change in the meaning. Sometimes it is hard to see any effect on the meaning, but this should only be seen as an aberration where a mechanism has become so automatized that you don't have alternatives. 

There may be different genitive endings in other languages than English, but normally the choice is dictated by common consent once you have chosen a given substantive. So using an -a with a Russian masculine substantive doesn't convey a different meaning than using an -i with a feminine one. You may say: if some prepositions govern one and only one case, then you don't have a choice and the meaning has disappeared in a pouff of green smoke. Well, it is definitely easier to see a meaning if you have contrasts between several possibilities to look at, but sometime long ago the speakers of that particular language chose a certain case for some reason, and that reason must have been semantically loaded. Automatizing constructions make discernable meanings fade away, but at the origin there was a meaning.

So what causes automatization? It can simply be common consent which weeds out some of the available alternatives, but it can also be phonetic considerations - please note that I didn't write 'phonematic': here it is the actual sounds that interfere with the meaning bearing units. If you look for instance Polish verbs you'll find a lot of apparent irregularities. But there are basically two kinds of irregularities: 1) irregularities caused by clashes between competing forms, 2)  sound changes caused by phonetic circumstances. 

In many languages some of the most common words are actually constructed like patchwork - witness the present tense forms of the English verb "to be": I am, you are, he IS, we are, you are, they are. Where did that "is" come from? Well, from another verb that long ago collided with a verb based on the 'a'-sound. The site Etymonline has these two explanations:

[am](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?%20term=am) (v.)  
*Old English eom "to be, to remain," (Mercian eam, Northumbrian am), from PIE *esmi- (cognates: Old Norse emi, Gothic im, Hittite esmi, Old Church Slavonic jesmi, Lithuanian esmi), from root *es-, the S-ROOT, which also yielded Greek esti-, Latin est, Sanskrit as-, and German ist.* 

*In Old English it existed only in present tense, all other forms being expressed in the W-BASE (see were, was). This cooperative verb is sometimes referred to by linguists as \*es-\*wes-. Until the distinction broke down 13c., \*es-\*wes- tended to express "existence," with beon meaning something closer to "come to be" (see be).*

*Old English am had two plural forms: 1. sind/sindon, sie and 2. earon/aron The s- form (also used in the subjunctive) fell from use in English in the early 13c. (though it continues in German sind, the 3rd person plural of "to be") and was replaced by forms of be, but aron (aren, arn, are, from Proto-Germanic *ar-, probably a variant of PIE root *es-) continued, and as am and be merged it encroached on some uses that previously had belonged to be. By the early 1500s it had established its place in standard English. Art became archaic in the 1800s.*
 
[is](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=is) (v.)  
*third person singular present of be, Old English is, from Germanic stem *es- (cognates: Old High German, German, Gothic ist, Old Norse es, er), from PIE *es-ti- (cognates: Sanskrit asti, Greek esti, Latin est, Lithuanian esti, Old Church Slavonic jesti), from PIE root *es- "to be." Old English lost the final -t-. See be. Until 1500s, pronounced to rhyme with kiss. Phrase it is what it is, indicating resigned acceptance of an unpleasant but inevitable situation or circumstance about which nothing positive really can be said, is attested by 2001.*

*"PIE" means Protoindoeuropean, which is the name for a reconstructed 'language' based on comparisons between forms in the oldest extant Indoeuropean languages and assumed to resemble their common ancestor.*

It is more than likely that there is some phonetic explanation for the opposition between *es- and *wes-, but it must lie very long back in time, and as this source suggests the pesky little "is" may actually be traced back to the same root as "am". But while this may be interesting for the historical linguists it is the similarities or lack of similarities between the current forms which should be of interest to a modern language learner, even when this means that you have to disregard some historical facts. 

Some linguists are too reluctant to cut the line back to the past, and one curious example of this is found in Polish grammar. Polish is a language with much more morphology than English, and it is also a language where the endings of verbal stems are very likely to be affected by the endings. But there is still a system behind the madness, and your task as a language learner is to internalize that system. Native speakers may have each form stored in their brains with a suitable set of construction instructions, but it took them many years to get so far. You are a language learner, and by seeing the logic behind the tables you can make a shortcut to learning them. 

To  ease my way into this arcane language I have bought Oscar E. Swan's "A Grammar of Contemporary Polish". Under the verbs it distinguishes four conjugations, and within each of these it stipulates a number of types named after the last part of their stems. Under the 2. conjugation Mr. Swan operates with a type based on " ł" (which is pronounced something like English "wh"), and he writes as follows: 

![Short extract from Oscar E. Swan's "A Grammar of Contemporary Polish" on stems with an underlying ł.](../3-2-image-1.jpg)

So actually this group is named after a consonant that totally has disappeared from the verbal paradigm, but left its mark on at least one derived substantive. And in the analysis of the 1. person singular the author postulates a 'j', which is totally invisible - except that it is blamed for the shift from "ł" to a flat "l". In many cases it can however explain a sound change, and that's why linguists still operate with this shadow of a 'j', that may have been a real sound long ago. 

I do appreciate etymology and explanations based on etymology, but for learning purposes it should only be invoked where it makes things clearer. If we only look at the present forms, the grand picture says that we have a system with four conjugations, each with a number of types with different stems, where we can expect a lot of sound changes - but there is some kind of logic in the changes. In fact it seems that almost all forms can be deduced if we just are informed about the shape of the 1. and 2. person singular. Do we then get these two forms served on a silver plate when we consult our Polish dictionaries? No, unfortunately not - shame on them! So we have to learn the most likely sound changes (and resulting spelling changes) by heart, and this is best done by noticing the relevant forms when we see or hear them.

We can use the Polish verbs to illustrate another type of mechanism, namely the combinatorics of the past tense. For this we use an illustration from Pons: Grammatik kurz und Bündig, Polnisch" (p.31):

![Verbal paradigm of a Polish verb in the past tense, from Pons: Grammatik kurz und Bündig, Polnisch..](../3-2-image-2.jpg)

As you can see the forms contain either the letter "ł" or the letter combination "li", followed by an ending that is reflect the gender in the singular and a distinction between personal and impersonal forms in the plural. Those of you who know Russian will recognize the 'l' sounds followed by essentially adjectival endings - but Polish has apparently added a personal ending taken from the finite verbal forms (or more likely: from a lost auciliary verb). The "i" versus "y" that distinguish between personal and impersonal forms are some of the possible plural endings of adjectives, and the Ø - a- o in the singular 3. person are clearly also the nominative singular endings of an adjective.  But how come that adjectival endings pop up in the morphological table for a verb? Well, the reason can be seen in Sorbian and the South Slavic languages. The weird l-form is actually an old active past participle. We don't have such a thing in the Romance or the Germanic languages, so it may surprise newcomers to the Slavic languages, but once you know the reasons for its development it doesn't seem as confusing any more.

Let's have a closer look at the construction with an auxiliary, using the verb "imenovati" ('to name') in Croatian. The source  is Pons' "Verbtabellen Kroatisch" (in German). The layout is different, but contains the same elements as the one given above for pracować. The new thing is the finite verbform in front of the participle, and this is actually the short present forms of the verb for 'to be' , "biti". There is also a long series: "jesam, jesi, jest, jesmo, jeste, jesu", but as an auxiliary verb the short series is used. So "je sam imenovao" actually would mean something like "I am been-naming", which became the most common past tense form, pushing out the other two in the proces: one named aorist and another named imperfect.  In Croatian the auxiliary verb survived (as in for instance Serbian and Bulgarian), but it disappeared in most of the other Slavic languages.

The Southern Slavic languages can be used to explain another puzzling item in Polish and Russian. To the left below you see the conditional of Croatian "imenovati", and here the auxiliary form is actually the otherwise extinct __aorist__ of "biti". In Russian you will recognize this as the indeclinable "бы", which now is seen as some kind of particle and not a verbal form. And as usual the Poles have chosen the most complicated solution they could think up, namely incorporating their "by" into the Polish conditional, which therefore consists of both the usual adjectival elements, the "by"-thing (which at least is left uninflected) followed by an inflected personal ending (seen to the right):

Warning: If you try to learn all the forms of the Polish verbs by rote memorizing you will drown! You'll find the nearest high tower and jump, screaming all the way down! Your rescue is to pin down the  mechanisms that produce the thousands of forms under specific conditions. Then you can start combining the elements in the hope that they add up to the forms actually in use.  Maybe you can do this by some kind of subconscious magic, but I prefer looking at the forms to see the pattern. Native speakers have seen all the forms so often that they have stored them as items in their brain, but if you are a newcomer to Slavic grammar then you don't have direct access to such a warehouse of readymade forms - but once you understand the logic behind the constructions you can learn to handle them with grace and ease. 

In other languages there will be other mechanisms and other patterns. The examples from the Slavic languages just serve to illustrate how the history of a language still is present in its modern form. You may not know about the history, but you can still benefit from looking for the structures it left behind.
