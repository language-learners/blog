title: 2.8 Other kinds of dictionaries and vocabulary lists
author: Iversen

There are several kinds of vocabulary lists and dictionaries in existence:

Monolingual dictionaries  
Bilingual dictionaries  
Multilingual dictionaries  
Etymological dictionaries  
Dictionaries for specific fields of knowledge  
Thematic wordlists  
Frequency tables and Swadesh lists  
Pictorial dictionaries  
Dictionaries with tons of genuine quotes on the internet

I have already given my reasons for preferring bilingual dictionaries over monolingual dictionaries in the preceding chapter. As for the multilingual dictionaries they run into the problem that semantic fields differ among languages, and it would be very difficult to describe these differences in a concise way for the complete vocabulary of x languages. The only place where they have a justification is in thematic wordlists - like for instance lists over the names of birds or tools. And even there I would only use them for reference - it would be quite confusing to learn the names in ten languages for strawberries or blackbirds in one go. I have owned a five language dictionary since the 70s, but I have never used it.

Swadesh lists (named after linguist Morris Swadesh) and frequency lists generally share one characteristic that make them unsuitable for memorization projects: they lack translations so you are supposed already to know the words before you consult them. But they could have fulfilled one important aspiration of all language learners, namely to know at least all the most important words in their target languages. As you saw in chapter 2.1 the number of very common words is exceedingly small. In the Kilgariff corpus only 96 English wordforms have a share of more than 0,1 %, and only 9 have one of more than 1%. 

How many words (or word forms) are so common that EVERY language learner should every one of them? I don't know the answer, but if you take all the 'grammatical' words including forms representing the different roots of irregular verbs etc. I doubt that you would reach 500 in any European language. You could ask another question: take a lot of separate corpora. Which - and how many - words or word forms a represented in almost all the samples? Again I have to admit that I don't know the answer, but that group of word/wordforms constitutes the basis of understanding and using any language.

The Swadesh lists were constructed for use in lexicostatistics (the quantitative assessment of the genealogical relatedness of languages) and glottochronology (the dating of language divergence), and that's definitely a good reason - for linguistist, less so for language learners. Such a list is composed of very common and supposedly central words because these words are supposed to be more stable than the rarer words, and therefore they can be used in language comparisons. But because of these characteristics they also contain words which every language learner must learn from the beginning - and not only that, but also learn to use in a multitude of ways and with great ease. Other linguists have compiled Swadesh list for other languages so that it now almost has become a generic term. 

You can learn a lot about the grammar words from a grammar book, and if words are really common you'll also automatically run into them in you study material - though maybe not into all of their special meanings or the expressions they are used in. But it is tempting start a 'mopping up' operation to fill out the holes, and the same applies to the words which follow further down on the frequency tables. One tempting way to do this is to find and memorize thematic lists, but at least for wordlists I have found that this is a bad idea: an attempt to memorize a large number of words with almost similar meanings bodes for confusion - but strangely enough I haven't had the same kind of problems with alphabetically ordered words, so similarities in semantic are apparently more likely to cause confusion , at least for me. 

If you want to learn the names of 27 species of crocodiles you should first find some information about each of these species so that you get on nodding terms with each species. There is no point in cramming names of croc species which you only know as mere names. And even when you have learnt something about ech and every species it is a bad idea to try to memorize all the names in one go - take max. 3-4 in one session, not more. The same applies to related words or idiomatic expressions you find in dictionaries: just learn 3-4 of these in any one session. 

What then about pictorial dictionaries? I own one old pictorial 5-language dictionary, "Hvad hedder det" from Politiken 1947 (sample below), and there are pictures with references to all the details in several of my 'normal' dictionaries - mostly in those of my monolingual dictionaries which have secret ambitions about becoming true encyclopedias.

But why use pictures in dictionaries at all? 

There are two cases: pictures with just one motive and pictures that illustrate a 'semantic field'. For me there is no doubt that the latter can be useful. For example you can show an old ship with sails, and you can point to each sail and give its name. Even though you didn't know that those sails even had names you now learn both that they have names and what those names are. That's useful information and such a picture with comments may be more valuable for a language learner than a tematic wordlist with the same words because you also get some information about the words which you might not even have in your own language. But in the example you still don't know whether the terminology is general or restricted to ships of a given type or from a certain period. In a true lexicon like Wikipedia you expect to get that information too.

Now move this idea to a bilingual dictionary and assume that you give the name for each sail in both languages (with a comment if the naming conventions in the two languages aren't parallel or if there are restrictions on period and type of setting). In this way you fuse just about every kind of memory hooks into one complex source, and that's just about everything a learner with a taste for images can wish for. 

What about pictures of just one thing? This is a completely different story. If you don't know the thing on the picture it doesn't help you much. A multiword picture wouldn't help you either if you much if you didn't already know the general setting, but if you could see for instance five different kinds of Greek vases with a name for each one you would be able to distinguish them later. With just one vase you can see that it is some kind of pottery, oh yeah, but you don't have a clue whether the word attached to the picture is a general word for pottery or a specific word for instance a big vase from Attica with two handles. In the bilingual case you can at least be lucky to know the name in your own language, and then you may be so extremely lucky that the foreign word covers the same set of uses - but you are just as likely to misinterpret the picture unless there also is an explanation. For abstract notions an explanation in words will normally be more effective (or maybe a film AND an explanation). 

So it is a hit or miss operation to show pictures with just one item - they may contain information you didn't have or they may just serve as decoration. Or they could easily show an irrelevant picture. In the bilingual case both are useful because you have a lifeline back to your base language in the form of a translation, but the multi-item picture is by definition more useful because it allows for comparisons, subdivision of semantic fields and for filling out lacunas in otherwise known semantic fields - even when these don't correspond exactly with the organization of the semantic field in your base language. 

With pictures that don't show concrete things the usefulness is even more questionable. The old adage - the one that claims that one picture say as much as 1000 words - may be caused by cases where the picture left you totally perplex, and even 1000 words of babble couldn't hide that. Which is one reason why systems like Rosetta Stoned don't function - if you don't know exactly which element or interpretation you should look for in a picture then it has failed its task. And the more abstract the notion you want to illustrate is, the less likely it is that any picture can help you. 

We have discussed learner types above, and one of the types that has been discussed is the 'visual' learner. In the few tests I have seen described the researchers believed that this could be tested by showing a learner a picture of something and saying a word (as an alternative to saying a word and giving an verbal explanation or a translation). But I have seen no indication that this would work. It would be much better to test the effectiveness of visual clues by showing five Greek vases as images and the corresponding words, as opposed to five vases with long descriptions in words. 

This discussion leads to the question about the usefulness of thematic wordlists and dictionaries. I recently passed a bookstore which had a 4-5 cm thick medical dictionary in the window ("Medicinsk-Odontologisk Ordbog Dansk-Engelsk/Engelsk-Dansk") - 838 pages! Gosh! I don't know how many headwords it constains, but I suspect that each of them is explained in painstaking detail - otherwise the book wouldn't be nearly as thick. And that means that it moves in the direction of encyclopedias and lexica. And that's fine. I once upon a time invested in the complete Grove's dictionary of Musci and Musicians in 29 volumns, which has its articles in alphabetical order. But if you do want to learn the words which are relevant for a certain area of knowledge then it would be more logical to read a book about that area. I have most of my knowledge about bird names in English from from field guides, where the birds are ordered according to their biological relationships, but most language learners would probably prefer reading less 'formal' genres and then just hope that they can pick up the relevant vocabulary in a less systematic fashion. That's OK, but the thing that isn't OK is to waste your time on thematic wordlists without those facts that make each item worth memorizing. 

And finally: with the advent of the internet we have got a new kind of dictionaries, where each word is illustrated by a number of quotes - sometimes even in a bilingual layout. The following images shows some of the quotes related to the Danish word "medicinsk" in the [glosbe.com](https://da.glosbe.com/da/en/medicinsk) dictionary:

![Screenshot with four examples of uses of medicinsk ('medical') in Danish from glosbe.com.](../2-8-image-1.jpg)

In good paper dictionaries there will also be examples, but mostly very short ones. And that's actually a good idea because they otherwise would be so thick that you would need a crane to move them around. On the internet you don't have to be so fuzzy about space and weight, and that makes it possible to get dictionaries where you can see the words and their translations in certified humanmade translations. And that may clear up some of the question you might have after a peek in a traditional dictionary. But you can also be led astray. In one of the examples above the Danish expression "Den seneste medicinske forskning" is juxtaposed with "Recent medical research" in English. The Danish version is actually a little bit more restrictive: the research is not only recent, but the *most* recent, if you write "den seneste". However such small issues are unavoidable even with texts taken from occifial sources. At the Esperanto World Congress in Lille 2015 I attended a lecture where official EU translations were compared, and the differences between the version were in some cases no less than shocking. 

Wikipedia can be used for a similar purpose. If you can find an article in your base language about a certain topic, then the mechanism that gives you links to articles in other languages about the same thing can give you access not only to one word, but to a host of other words from the same semantic field. But again: this information is presented in a less strict way and there is no garantee that the articles correspond in their choice of words. You have been equipped with a splendid new tool, but it doesn't make your oldfashioned alphabetic dictionaries superfluous.

And just one last warning: Google translate should NOT be used as a dictionary. It does provide lists with possible translations for specific words, but these lists are far from complete, and sometimes they contain glaring errors. Use a real dictionary.
