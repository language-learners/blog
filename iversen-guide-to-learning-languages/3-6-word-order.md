title: 3.6 Word order

A sentence has a main structure that comprises a number of syntagmata and clauses, and each of these may have an inner structure and so on. If the world was a simple place no component would be discontinuous, but you can't count on that. 

Let's start from the easy end: **prepositional phrases**, which consist of a preposition plus a substantival syntagm (which can have its own inner structure). One name used for the substantival syntagm in a prepositional phrase is **regimen**, but in English this name is also used about other parts of a sentence, and the same applies to the currently used alternative word 'object'. So the terminology in the English grammatical tradition is rotten, and I stick with 'regimen' as the least bad choice. 

Actually you also can have 'prepositions' that stands after the substantival syntagma, and then they are called postpositions, and both kinds together are called adpositions. In some languages some words can be both pre- and postpositions (like "nach" and "wegen" in [German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postposition)), but according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition) you have to go to something as exotic as the native Californian Timbisha language to find an 'inposition', where the adposition settles within the substantival syntagma. But you don't have to go further than English to find a language where prepositional clauses are split - to the teeth-gnashing chagrin of a few die-hard purists. But frankly, a construction used by almost all native speakers should be defined as correct. Instead of trying to kill a correct construction, it is more relevant to study the reasons that the clause was split in the first place, and the typical reason is that the role of regimen is taken by an interrogative or relative pronoun, which has to take the initial position in a question or subordinate clause: "<span style="color:red">what</span> does he think <span style="color:maroon">of</span>? Well, obviously the thing (<span style="color:red">which</span>) he is thinking <span style="color:maroon">of</span>". 

*"Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris*  
*Italiam, fato profugus, <span style="color:maroon">Lavinia</span>que venit <span style="color:maroon">litora</span>,"*

*I sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate,*  
*first came from the coast of Troy to Italy, and to <span style="color:maroon">Lavinian shores</span>*

This is the beginning of the Aeneid (translation borrowed from [poetryintranslation.com](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidI.htm)). As you probably know Latin is notorious for its discontinuous syntagms, though the problem as expected is worst in poetry. When you *know* that this is possible then it isn't as hard to piece the elements together as you might think, but in my opinion the reason isn't the one usually given, namely the concording case, number and gender, but more the semantics - you expect some qualification of a noun, and then you find something suitable. But that is of course difficult to formulate in operational terms, and therefore Latin teachers have always emphasized the morphological criteria.
 
Notice also the two instances of "-que" - something as unusual as a postclitic conjunction: "arms <span style="color:maroon">man</span>-And (I-)sing, (from)Troia <span style="color:maroon">who</span> ..."

A substantival syntagm in English will typically have the substantive last and a number of other elements in front of it, and the order of these elements can conveniently be described by a field model - but if you look at other languages their field structures will often be different, and there can be several competing model. In French most adjectives  are placed after the substantive, but a number of very common adjectives are prepositioned or used before or after with a difference in meaning: "un pauvre homme" (a poor wretched fellow) vs. "un homme pauvre" (an impecunious person). But you won't ever see *pauvre un homme or *homme un pauvre, which shows that there is a field model behind the word order, and as a language learner you need to find out about this model, which may exist in several versions. The constraints are most visible in cases where your target language differs from your native one, but even with related languages you have to be on guard.

In chapter 3.2 I mentioned the postclitic articles of the Nordic languages, but there are some subtle differences in their use. The Swedish author Strindborg wrote a book called "Röda rummat" - but in Danish that's not possible: here it must be "Det røde rum" (with a prepositioned definite article because of the adjective). In Swedish you can also have double article, as in "Det röda rummet", but that's not allowed in Danish.

We can introduce other kinds of words in a substabtival syntagm: numerals, demonstratives etc - and you can also add relative clauses and prepositional clauses. I'm not going to write a lot about those possibilities, but can't resist quoting a couple of German sentences (from [Herdamitfestival.com](http://www.herdamitfestival.com/datenschutz/) - but they are by no means unusual):

*<span style="color:maroon">Die auf dieser Website veröffentlichten Inhalte</span> unterliegen <span style="color:olive">dem deutschen Urheber- und Leistungsschutzrecht</span>. <span style="color:purple">Jede vom deutschen Urheber- und Leistungsschutzrecht nicht zugelassene Verwertung</span> bedarf <span style="color:navy">der vorherigen schriftlichen Zustimmung des Anbieters oder jeweiligen Rechteinhabers</span>.*

*<span style="color:maroon">The on this homepage published contents</span> aresubjectto <span style="color:olive">the German author- and outputprotectionlaw</span>. <span style="color:purple">Every fromThe German author- and outputprotectionlaw not permitted use</span> needs <span style="color:navy">the previous written accept ofThe provider or current rightsOwner</span>.*
 
And the funny thing is that once you have learnt German well you will find this system both natural and efficient. The trick is to look for the internal system of sticks and boxes, and contrary to Latin each box is usually kept together - \*'Die <span style="color:purple">auf</span> veröffentlichten <span style="color:purple">dieser Website</span> Inhalte' is *not* allowed. 

In some languages there are elements which serve roles not found in English, and I would like to mention a case in Greek. Let's first see the effect of the introduction of a possessive pronoun:

"The small house" can be translated into "το μικρό σπίτι" (/to mikró spiti/)  
"My small house" can be translated into "το μικρό σπίτι μου" (/to mikró spiti mu/, the small house my - 8 hits on Google), but  it is more common to introduce a socalled emphatic possessive: "το δικó μου μικρó σπíτι" (/to dhikó mu mikró spiti/, 236 hits). OK, small numbers, but the tendency is clear. 

Let's leave it at that. The message is: look for a field model with slots for different kinds of words. And even exceptions or alternatives should defined in terms of such a model. But it also has to be stresssed that to actually use the relevant patterns in speech you don't have time to consult a grammar: those patterns have to be stored and automatized in your mind.

Let's leave the substantival syntagms and look at the verbal ones. In a dependency or valency grammar the whole sentence is seen as an extended verbal syntagm, but there is also a narrower environment around the verb. Her you find among other things the unstressed personal pronouns, whose precise combination possibilities can become a nightmare. When I was taught French long ago we were shown something called "the circles of Sandfeld" which practically solved the problem:

![Diagram illustrating the French circles of Sandfeld. The pronouns me, te, se, nous, vous appear on the left of the Venn diagram, le and la in the center, and lui and leur on the right.](../3-6-image.jpg)

You can combine the pronouns within one circle, but not from the parts of the circles that don't overlap. It may not always be possible to draw circles, but the combination rules of a languages can normally be rationalized to make them easier to remember. And even a rationalization that doesn't cover each and every weird combination can be valuable. 

Finally: what about word order at the sentence level? It is a fairly well known factoid that the verbs in German have a tendency to be postponed for as long as possible, making them pile up at the very end of the speech and causing endless problems for simultaneous interpretors who have to tread water while they wait for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Actually this special word order is reserved for subordinate clauses, which of course can be bad enough. The cause is the rule that puts a conjunction in the beginning of the clause, which leads to some internal rearranging:

She arrives today --> sie kommt heute  
*I hope that she today arrives --> ich hoffe, daß sie heute kommt  
*She is arrived yesterday --> sie ist gestern gekommen  
*I know that she yesterday arrived is --> ich weiß, daß sie gestern gekommen ist

You can't discuss word order at the sentence level without mentioning the typology based on basic word order, which results in types like SVO (most Western European languages), SOV (Latin) and VSO (Irish) (quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order)): 

*There are six theoretically possible basic word orders for the transitive sentence: subject–verb–object (SVO), subject–object–verb (SOV), verb–subject–object (VSO), verb–object–subject (VOS), object–subject–verb (OSV) and object–verb–subject (OVS). The overwhelming majority of the world's languages are either SVO or SOV, with a much smaller but still significant portion using VSO word order. The remaining three arrangements are exceptionally rare, with VOS being slightly more common than OSV, and OVS being significantly more rare than the two preceding orders*

One problem with that is not all languages are based on those categories. For instance an ergative language will only have a subject with an intransitive verb. With transitive verbs it has an object s expected, but it corresponds to the subject of an intransitive verb, and instead of a subject it then has something called an agent, which is in another case than the subject of an intransive verb. But according to Wikipedia "The label [SVO] is often used for ergative languages which do not have subjects, but have an agent–verb–object order." - problem solved. 

The idea of a basic word order is shaky - we have just seen that German subordinates aren't SVO, but more like SOV, and Latin word order is close to being anarchic - in poetry it IS anarchic. The main excuse for using the typology is the excellent work of linguists like Greenberg, who have shown that there are solid statistical evidence for its relevance. These connexions can be formulated as universals, and it is worth noting that the universals - contrary to those of Chomsky - aren't supposed to be inborn parts of the language mechanism, but instead something that has been formulated on the basis of empirical fieldwork. I'll quote a few rules from an article written by W.Bisang ("Typed of [Universals](http://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/summerschool2002/Bisang3.PDF), Greenberg's Universals"):

*Universal 1: In declarative sentences with nominal subject and object, the dominant order is almost always one in which the subject precedes the object.*

On alternative word order types within one and the same language:

*Universal 6: All languages with dominant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic order.*
