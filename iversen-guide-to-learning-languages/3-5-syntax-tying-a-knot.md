title: 3.5 Syntax - tying a knot

One way of studying a grammatical problem is first to read about it in a grammar book and then proceed to finding some genuine examples. If it is a common phenomenon this shouldn't be too hard, especially in those cases where you can use a search machine to find them. If you haven't seen any example outside your grammar then it might still be relevant to learn about it, but just as with words and expressions the more common things should take precedence.
 
One little, but important warning: don't waste time on writing down the examples in their full length, but cut them down to the important part - and don't try to remember the examples you find as full sentences, but cut them down to short mnemonic formulas such as "to do something to somebody" (with suitable dummy words). If you want to find them again you can add a reference.

Later on you should keep a notebook for funny syntactical items, not least those that you have been looking in vain for. This will keep you alert, and being alert is one of the most efficient things when it comes to learning languages. This also applies to idiomatic expressions, which is in a sense the continuation of syntax when it has become too fragmented to put into a fixed structure.

For me the key to memorizing syntactical patterns is reduction of these patterns to something I can boil down to a rule of thumb and/or visualize in the form of sticks and boxes (or bubbles, as below). 

To take a concrete example: assume that I have seen the French relative pronoun 'lequel' for the first time, and now I want to learn to use it. My grammar tells me that it is both a relative pronoun and an interrogative pronoun, and a big fat old grammar like Grevisse would also give some examples from venerated and famous authors, - including some written in a style that would feel obsolete and stilted even to native French writers of today. I am perfectly aware that these quotes are necessary for the linguist who has to research something before writing a paper about it, but they are too complicated for me who just want to learn the use of the word "lequel". So what I want to see is the morphological information that "lequel" is inflected ("laquelle" if the reference is feminine, lesquelles in plural, "duquel" and "auquel" when combined with the prepositions "de" resp. "à") plus some simplified examples of its use in different constructions:

As an interrogative pronoun:

Lequel?  
Lequel des [noun phrase in plural] ... ?

As a relative pronoun, nominal function: 

[antecedent], lequel ....  
[antecedent], lequel ....

As a relative pronoun, adjectival function: 

[antecedent], lequel [noun]….   (stone dead, but can be seen in older literature) 

OK, I have become interested in "lequel", and based on the grammars I now have concocted a list of the constructions it is supposed to occur in. Next phase in the evil old days would be have been to be on the lookout for examples for several weeks, and during that time I would have jumped into the air of joy every time I found one. With the advent of the search machines and the internet this has become much simpler: I still have to know the different forms of lequel, but I can now make a quick search for each of them. Let's try not "lequel" itself, but the feminine form "laquelle". Leaving aside company names and references to dictionaries and wiktionaries and other rubbish, I find these quotes: 

Histoire des insectes; dans laquelle ces animaux sont rangés suivant un ordre méthodique…  
relative pronoun (NB: book title from 1799, so maybe a bit oldfashioned)

Percussion! mais laquelle? -  interrogative pronoun, - used without "de", but in a very short question

Laquelle des trois M te ressemble le plus? - interrogative pronoun used with "de" in a nominal phrase in a more extended phrase 

Raison pour laquelle je blogue -- substantival relative pronoun ("[this is the] reason for which I blog") 

This should be enough, - the following examples are just repeats of these patterns. But looking through such a series of examples with the simplified patterns in your head is one sure way of making you understand the mechanics of at least this corner of French grammar. In my opinion it is the combination of a simple catalogue of patterns and a lot of relevant examples that is the best way of learning syntax. 

The example with 'lequel' was easy because you could search for a single word in a limited number of shapes. Other syntactical phenomena are harder to find through a simple search, like the rules that describe word order. But the proposed method is still to consider how the rules should be formulated and then to have a look in the real world to check the usefulness of those rules. And if you simply can't find any examples of a phenomenon from your grammar  in the real world then it isn't strictly necessary to learn it here and now.

For something slightly more complex, let's have a look at some constructions which are based on transformations - including the thing called a **sentence knot**.

Think of a sentence as something organized around a verb. Think about subordinate phrases as phrases which function as a member (call it 'constituent' or whatever - I don't care) in another sentence - and normally there is a conjunction of some sorts which often also is a pronoun with a reference somewhere. In other word a subordinate phrase is like a little box in a big box. And in the little box there can be an even smaller box. The conjunction (whether pronominal or 'empty') is typically at the start of the phrase to which it belongs. 

Now imagine that you have a three tier system, but the connecting word is actually a relative pronoun which - when judged on its function - clearly belong to the lowest level. So you have V1 rel3 V2 V3 : 

<span style="color:green">something could happen</span> --->  
<span style="color:red">I told you</span> <span style="color:green">(that) something could happen</span> --->  
This is exactly the thing <span style="color:green">which</span> <span style="color:red"> I told you</span> <span style="color:green">could happen</span> --->

Number three is a sentence knot.

Notice that the first phrase (a variant of V3) starts out having an indefinite pronoun as its subject, and in the final construction the subject is a relative pronoun which points to "thing" at the topmost layer. So in spite of claims in bad grammars the linking pronoun  does not 'belong' to the nearest verb V2, but to V3. 

And that's what makes the sentence knot a knot - not the word order alone, as stated in some grammars (insofar they even mention the phenomenon).

Sentence knots can be found in many Romance and Germanic languages, and in Danish they are especially common - maybe because we under certain conditions can drop the conjunctions, which makes the whole thing even more Gordian-like: 

Jeg ville sige **noget** <span style="color:green">om et eller andet</span> --->  
Jeg sagde, at jeg ville sige **noget** <span style="color:green">om et eller andet</span> --->  
Det var just **det** <span style="color:green">(som)</span> <span style="color:red">jeg sagde</span> <span style="color:green">(at) jeg ville sige noget om</span>  
It was exactly that (which) I said (that) I would say something about 

This thing about sentence knots may seem like a rather unimportant curiosity - especially if your target language doesn't permit them - but it is just one among several things that tend to be overlooked in normal grammars. In sentence knots there is a reference from a deeply buried sentence to an element in a sentence several layers higher up in the hierarchy, skipping an intermediate layer. 

Another, more frequent construction is the 'cleft sentence' where some element is pulled up to a higher level where it becomes the subject predicative:

<span style="color:green">I want to say **this**</span>---> <span style="color:green">what I want to say</span> is **this**---> **this** is <span style="color:green">what I want to say</span>  
<span style="color:green">that this is the wrong colour</span> is evident ---> **it**'s evident <span style="color:green">that this is the wrong colour</span>

You may remember group 3 of subordinate clauses from chapter 3.4: "The third group contains a mixed construction without antecedents, but also not something which somebody would have said as a sentence or question. Some have called them 'independent relative clauses', but this has no basis in reality - except maybe that they often can be replaced by true relative clauses with a dummy antecedent. Their conjunction is mostly filled in by an interrogative pronoun:".  The sentence "**this** is <span style="color:green">what I want to say</span>" contains such a cluse, and the clause in "**it**'s evident <span style="color:green">that this is the wrong colour</span>" is an 'argument clause' (group one). Both "this" and "it" are pronouns, demonstrative resp. personal. You might ask: what is the role of the demonstrative or personal pronoun in a cleft sentence? It is obvious that it only pops up once the sentence has been transformed, and that it is coreferential with the subordinate clause. In Danish we say "foreløbigt grundled", i.e. 'provisional subject', and that is as good a name as any.

Cleft constructions obviously also exist in other languages, and one of the most conspicuous phrases in French is actually a cleft sentence turned interrogative:

"qu'est-ce que c'est que ça?" (what is-it that it-is (ahem) that? = what is it?) .. from an affirmative "C'est ça que c'est", which again is a transformation of the simpler, but less used sentence "[ce que c'est] est ça", in which "que c'est" is an ordinary relative clause with "ce" as its antecedent.

This "qu'est-ce que c'est (que ça)?" is so common - both in its full and its 'light' version -that even newbee learners almost certainly would learn it by heart without even thinking about its complicated inner structure. But it's a productive contruction with new examples being produced all the time, and .. well, I can't know what you think, but for me it is easier to deal with such constructions in a new language if I can reduce them to sticks and boxes. And I actually do think cleft sentences are funny.
