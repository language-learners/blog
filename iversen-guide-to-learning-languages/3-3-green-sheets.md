There are language learners who claim never to study grammar, and evidently children don't do it so learning a grammar book by heart can obviously not by the only way to learn grammar - and maybe it isn't even a viable method. If you want to learn grammar - and now I'm not only thinking of morphology, but also syntax and idiomatics - you have to do it in an interplay between the discovery of rules and testing them out in practice, and you have to do this in stages. Here I'll assume you aren't allergic to grammar books, but they can be intimidating - how can you survive grammar?

First, try to get more than one grammar. If you can't get a fullsize grammar then even the short sketchy grammatical sections of travelers' language guides will be better than nothing, but it will be easier to see the patterns if you see them from more than one angle. Your first task will be to look through the morphological sections and compare them. Do they agree on the terminology? The order of cases? The number of declensions? Do the divide the verbs into corresponding groups, and do they list the same verbal forms? Probably not, which may come as a nasty surprise to some learners. 

Now look at the adjectives and the substantives. Do their endings in the different cases - if there are cases at all - look almost similar or not? Are there articles? Look at the verbs in the same way, - try to get a comprehensive view of the whole morphology in this way. Then leave the morphology aside and read the syntactical sections with the same critical attitude. Which kinds of subordinate sentences are there, and which constructions with infinite verbal forms do you find, which may or may not correspond to subordinate constructions and vice versa in the languages you already know. Remember, you are not supposed to learn any of these things by heart yet, just find out what there is to learn later. 

Next step, - you have to learn something by heart, sorry. But don't do it without also having some texts to use at the same time. I say texts because I find it easier to read than to understand spoken words in the beginning, - if you have a teacher then by all means listen to him/her, but find some things to read also, - preferably bilingual texts. The internet may be a good source for parallel texts, or you can get some from text books or touristical guidebooks, but DO try to use bilingual texts in the beginning - this will spare you a lot of misunderstandings and a lot of half-understood constructions along the way. And most translations aren't so precise that they will do all the work for you - you will still have to look things up. If you can find hyperliteral translations then just be happy, but they are rare. If necessary, read the chapter about bilingual texts to learn to make them yourself.

Among the first things to learn by heart would be the main forms of the most common verbs including the auxiliaries, the pronouns, prepositions and things like that. You will have to learn them by heart eventually so you can just as well start now. Do what most people do: read them aloud many times, write them, find them in your texts and identify the forms, make associations (if you can) and so forth. Do the same kind of forced slave labour with some of the forms of articles and  - and then put the grammar or grammars away and look for the forms in your texts. You could be learning all the forms in the book without being able to identify them or use them in actual sentences. And the problem is worse with grammar than with words. So the process where you skip back and forth between the grammar book and the world outside the book should start as early as possible. 

Next step: look at the morphological tables and try to find the main distinctions and separate the exceptions from the regular forms - taking into account the problem I described in the preceding chapter, namely that phonetic rules may cause regular changes in the forms that were supposed to be regular. This means that the 100% regular paradigms may be are, but then you have to see what you can rescue from the mess. There must be something regular, otherwise the language would be unlearnable.

When you think you see a regular pattern you should try to write it down on paper. Maybe just ordinary white paper in the beginning, but eventually you should use some better paper which make these sheets easily recognizable and more durable. I use thick green paper, and therefore my word for these records has become 'green sheets'.  The idea is that you keep these colored sheets within in sight whenever you work with the language - personally I use a note stand. 

If you see a form that bothers you (or you need a specific while writing) then look at your collection of coloured sheets. Making these sheets yourself makes you think about each single form, and looking at them daily for maybe a month will make them into something like an extension of your brain. Therefore it is also extremely important that you settle for a specific way of presenting the facts, because the system you choose with a bit a luck eventually will be the system that gets engrained into your brain. Maybe there are a few small errors -  OK, then correct them, but if you get unhappy with the layout itself then you may have to change the system.

As you probably have noted your grammars aren't in total agreement. Maybe you can even spot some inconsistencies. Now think hard about a way to organize the forms of articles and adjectives and nouns on one sheet (maybe two), and all the verbal forms on another - and do it in a logical fashion. For instance all Germanic languages have strong and weak verbs (the first group basically changes the verb stem  through the tenses, the second depends entirely on endings for its distinctions). Your tables should show that double system in some way - use colors or special signs or different kinds of dividing lines for such things. Don't put irregular forms into your tables for the regular forms, - if a set of endings is used only by two or three verbs then leave them for a list over irregular nouns or verbs or whatever - these tables aren't meant to contain everything, but only the basic things which you must learn as patterns sooner or later.

When I first wrote about my 'green sheets' almost everybody criticized that I only wrote the endings. But this criticism was misguided: by using whole example words you tie the tables to a few example words. That isn't a bad idea if you expect people to learn grammar by studying the tables. However in practice you will almost always have a specific word in mind when you use the  tables on the green sheets, so it doesn't matter that they only contain the endings. And with only the endings you can make the tables much more compact so that you ideally can fit the whole regular part of the morphology of any (friendly) language into maybe 4 or 5 sheets. Plus a number of sheets for pronouns and other more or less irregular adjectives, nouns and verbs.

For instance it takes many pages to get through the forms of the adjectives and the substantives in Latin. This allows the authors to mention exceptions and give examples of word that adhere to a certain pattern. The result is that it takes time to find the relevant spot if you are in doubt about a certain form. And to boot the rules for the use of each form are typically found in another chapter. One green sheet can contain the most common of all the forms in the book, and the price for this is that it doesn't include the exceptions or lists of words in each category (and even less the syntactical rules) - but you can find the information it does contain in a flash.
 
To learn syntax you can to some degree make similar 'green sheets' - like lists over the cases governed by different prepositions or the verbal forms used in different kinds of subordinates or infinite verbal constructions. But most of the syntax has to be learnt using other methods because those things depend on structures that can't easily be given in table form. 

Let's stick with morphology and have a look as some concrete examples. First the Icelandic verbs:

![Tables summarizing Icelandic verbal inflectional morphology.](../3-3-image-1.jpg)

From top to bottom you see first the forms of the present indicative, below the subjunctive, then the past indicate followed by the past conditional. And at the bottom the infinite forms. From left to right you first see five tables with weak verbs, then one full table with a strong verb and a few forms of one more (mostly to point out that the 2. person singular may have a special form). Along right margin you see  eight patterns of vowel changes in strong verbs plus the compound verbal forms, exemplified by the first person singular.

Your will notice that truly irregular verbs like "að vera" (to be) aren't included. The strong verbs are there because they aren't really irregular - they just have a vowel shift, which mostly is predictable. And if not, then you simply have to learn the pattern with each verb. There is one detail which you should notice: the forms köllum and kölluðum from the verb "kalla" (call) look irregular, but it is actually the rule that an "u" in the following syllable changes an "a" into "ö". 

The vowel changes of the strong verbs were actually caused the vowel changes in the paradigms of the strong verbs, but at an earlier stage: the endings that caused them belonged to the "Proto-Norse" language which preceded "Old Norse", and they disappeared before the Old Norse stage - but left their mark in the vowel changes of the strong verbs.

And by the way: if you think the system above reminds you of High German then you aren't quite off the mark: Icelandic and High German have both preserved their Medieval inflections almost unchanged, where other Germanic languages have simplified their system.

The table below contains just about anything you need to know about the nominal syntagms of Icelandic, including pre- and postpositioned articles, regular adjectives and regular weak and strong substantives. The first column gives the case names (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive), the following three columns gives the  'strong'  forms of the adjectives, then after the double vertical line you see the prepositioned articles (derived from a demonstrative pronoun), the 'weak' adjectival forms, the strong substantives, the weak substantives and the postpositioned articles for the masculine, followed by the same forms for the feminine and the neutral. 

![Table summarizing Icelandic nominal inflectional morphology.](../3-3-image-2.jpg)

There is one truly rotten case of terminology at play here, but I can't avoid it: when you speak about weak and strong verbs and substantive you speak about different classes of verbs and substantives, but with adjectives you have the same adjectives in roles where they use either the weak or the strong set of  endings: the weak when there is an article or something similar in the slot before them in the substantival syntagma, the strong set when there isn't such a thing or when they are used alone. This also determines the position of the article: without an article you generally use the postclitic article, but with an article you have to use the prepositioned independent form.

On the Icelandic sheet right above you have probably noticed that some columns have been marked "AJ" (adjective), but the rest of the columns have not been marked with word class - after all I made the sheet for my own personal use. But this gives me an opportunity to explain some principles behind the setup. 

First you have three columns marked with the signs for masculine, feminine and .. OK, my own invention .. neuter (¤). These columns refer to adjectives standing alone, most likely as some kind of predicative. Inside the following three sections - one for each gender and separated by double vertical lines - you first see the prepositioned definite article (there is no indefinite article in Icelandic) plus one form for the adjective. This is a reflection of the structure of the language: you use the prepositioned article if there is an adjective in a substantive clause. Otherwise you use the postclitic article, which is shown after the substantive endings. And that article has its own endings so in a substantive with such an article there are actually two endings in one word: substantive+ substantive ending plus article +article ending. The endings of the substantive are divided by a vertical dotted linje into endings for strong substantives and endings for weak substantive. In the dative ou see a cross over an -m. That's because there is an ending -um when there isn't a postclitic article, blut the last -m is dropped in the presence of the article:  - um --->   -u()num. Apart from that spot it's all a matter of simple combinatorics. There are no other assimilation phenomena.

When I made the corresponding green sheet for Latin it turned out the be necessary to give it another structure. Latin doesn't use articles (which simplifies matter greatly!), and the endings of the adjectives are very close to those of the substantives. And the plethora of endings for each group it was logical to show the substantives and the adjectives on top of each other. In Icelandic it was possible and desirable to show the structure of the noun phrase, wherease that's less relevant in Latin. On the other hand Latin has more 'columns' to fit into the table both for adjectives and nouns, but the sets endings mostly are the same for the two word classes. 

![Table summarizing the inflectional endings of Latin nouns and adjectives.](../3-3-image-3.jpg)

The sheet below shows the forms of  the adjectives and substantives in Modern Greek (the articles should really have been there too, but they don't combine with the substantives like they did in Icelandic so their absence is less problematic): 

![Table summarizing the inflectional endings of Modern Greek nouns and adjectives.](../3-3-image-4.jpg)

The main feature is one you can't see, namely that Greek adjectives have three genders, and there are some typical 'ending sets': if the masculine singular nominative is ος, then the femininum and neutrum can be  α ο  or η ο, but if it is υς then they will almost certainly be η and υ or ια and υ . So the columns with adjectival endings go from top to bottom, whereas the substantives have one gender each so here a column contains masculine, feminine and neutral substantives with similar endings. The table is not complete - I have left out some katherevousa forms - but it contains just about everything a beginner needs to know. Except the articles and other determiners of course. 

The last green sheet is different: it doesn't show morphology, but syntax in the shape of the cases governed by different prepositions in Polish. And the important thing here is to illustrate some simple rules of thumb: with <u>one</u> exception (z/ze) the prepositions governing the genitive ONLY govern this case. Those that govern the instrumental also govern the accusative apart from <u>one</u> that only governs the instrumental and <u>one</u> that governs the genitive instead of the accusative. Similarly those that govern the locative also govern the accusative apart from <u>one</u> that only governs the locative ... and finally there are a few which are reserved for the dative:
