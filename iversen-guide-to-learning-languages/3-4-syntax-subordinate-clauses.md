title: 3.4 Syntax - subordinate clauses
author: Iversen
---
There is something called an pronoun and another thing called a conjunction. An pronoun is a word that points to something else. If it has an implied reference in the real world it is a demonstrative,  if the reference is just something vague somewhere then it is an indefinite, if the solution is expected to come in an answer to a question then it is interrogative, and if the reference goes to something in the (main) sentence then it can in certain cases be a relative pronoun, or it can be a demonstrative. I'm not going into any philosophical hairsplitting about these traditional categories, - show me a language where they are irrelevant, and we'll work out a solution from there. 

Conjunctions are things that tie subordinate sentences to something in the main sentence, or they can tie two or more elements together within one sentence. Right now we only deal with conjunctions at the sentence level, and the conjunctions here can be pronouns, but also words which from a synchronic point of view don't seem to have any trace of anaphoric function. However even these conjunctions may once have had a reference - it is a strange coincidence that most conjunctions in argument clauses (or whatever you call them - "phrases complétives" in French) looks like or had older forms that looked like demonstratives. So maybe the idea once upon a time was that they had a reference, namely the whole clause following them:  "I say **that**: "this is a weird idea" --->  "I say <span style="color:green">**that** this is a weird idea</span>". The Danish "at" is one of the conjunctions that look meaningless, but it goes back to Old Norse  "það", which still is used in Icelandic - the same word as English "that". 

We have to broaden the definition of the word 'pronoun'. This word literally says that it is something that replaces a substantive, though most grammars in spite of the name tacitly also accept adjectival pronouns. For me there is no reason to exclude words that typically have adverbial functions from the pronouns, so I consider words like "then", "how", "so" and "sometimes" as just as much pronouns as "me" or "what" or "somebody". Or I call them pro-words to placate the manes of those bygone grammarians who coined the word 'pronoun'. This change in terminology has consequences for the analysis of certain subordinate clauses, including a number formerly called adverbial ("I'll tell you more <span style="color:green">**when** I'm ready</span>"). 

I will now just sketch the main types of subordinate clauses, using the notions that I have just introduced. 

The **first** group are the argument clauses, which are used in typically substantival functions - mostly verbs that indicate questions or affirmations. There are three kinds:  
1) those where the clause represent a simple declarative sentence  
it is weird   ---->   I say <span style="color:green">that it is weird</span>  
2, 3) those where it is based on 'full' or 'partial' questions  
is it weird?  ---->  I don't know <span style="color:green">whether this is weird </span>  
why is it weird?   ---> I don't know <span style="color:green">why this is weird</span>
	
The **second** group is formed by the relative clauses (in a broad sense), where the conjunction is a relative pro-word with some element in the surrounding main clause functioning as its antecedent. If you would isolate the subordinate clause then you would have to replace the relative pronoun with its antecedent:

This sentence may sound weird  ----> I have said a sentence, <span style="color:green">which may sound weird</span>  
My sentence may sound weird   ----> I am the person, <span style="color:green">whose sentence may sound weird</span>  
I said a weird sentence today  ----> This is the day, <span style="color:green">where I said a weird day</span>

NB: in most grammatical traditions the last sentence would be seen as adverbial because the antecedent is analyzed as a temporal adverbial, but the parallel with the preceding sentences is obvious, and besides the so-called 'adverbials' which indicate time and amount are more often than not filled in with a substantive.

The **third** group contains a mixed construction without antecedents, but also not something which somebody would have said as a sentence or question. Some have called them 'independent relative clauses', but this has no basis in reality - except maybe that they often can be replaced by true relative clauses with a dummy antecedent. Their conjunction is mostly filled in by an interrogative pronoun:

nonrelative: Some day I'll say a weird sentence    --->    You will be somewhere else <span style="color:green">**when** I say a weird sentence</span>  
relative: You will be somewhere else <span style="color:red">the day</span> <span style="color:green">(**when**) I say a weird sentence</span>
				   
The message in all this is once again that you should try to dissolve complicated structures in their components, and in the case of embedded sentences this means that you should try to find the logic in the way normal sentences change when they are incorporated as subordinate clauses in other sentences. And as far as I can see such structural arguments lead to a more logical categorization system than the traditional one, which is based on wordclasses. 

Relative pro-words in English and other Western language have typically two roles: the one as conjunctional and another one. The system with combined conjunctions-cum-pronouns can break together in a number of ways ways, such as when the role of pronoun and conjunction are separated or a word in the subordinate duplicates the pronoun aspect of the conjunctions-cum-pronouns. Actually it is weird that we have words with two roles, and many languages outside the Indoeuropean group haven't got them, but any grammatical system worth its salt should be able to deal with such phenomena. For a lot of examples see A.Murelli's dissertation "Relative Constructions in European Languages: A Look at [Non](https://www.google.dk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjL8cTD9M_KAhUHEiwKHUrBDdAQFggoMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Flipp.ub.lmu.de%2Findex.php%2Flipp%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F22%2F21&usg=AFQjCNFoVr8KVkQdqYktnUQAZ8wItwLczQ&bvm=bv.113034660,d.bGg)-Standard". I would like to mention a couple of constructions in Danish which are considered as errors - but they are so common that they just as well could be accepted as correct and inevitable parts of Danish.

We have a construction with "der" as 'preliminary' subject:  
"Der kommer en dame nu" (* there comes a lady now)

.. and we have substantival clauses with 'at':  
"Jeg hører <span style="color:green">at der kommer en dame nu</span>" (* I hear <span style="color:green">that there comes a lady now</span>)

We have relative clauses with "som" and "der" and nothing. "Som" (roughly = 'as') can be subject and object, "der" (roughly = "there") can only be subject and nought (■) can be object, but not subject. The funny thing is that 'at' in informal language can penetrate into relative constructions, but even this system obeys a clear logic - as if the 'at' tries to usurp the role as general conjunction in all kinds of subordinate clauses, which leads to problems with the double nature of the pro-word . 

Standard constructions:

subject: Her er damen, <span style="color:green">der/som kommer nu</span> (* here is theLady, <span style="color:green">that/who comes now</span>)  
object: Her er damen, <span style="color:green">som/■ jeg har set komme</span>  (* here is theLady, <span style="color:green">whom/■ I have seen come</span>)

Non-standard constructions:

subject: Her er damen, <span style="color:green">**som at der** kommer nu</span> (* here is theLady, <span style="color:green">**as that who** comes now</span>)  
object: Her er damen, <span style="color:green">**som at ■** jeg har set komme</span>  (* here is theLady, <span style="color:green">**as that** I have seen come</span>)  
The interesting thing here is that only "som at der" (or just "som at") is possible when the pronoun(s) fill out the role as subject - not "der at som". This hints at the possibility that the construction with the 'preliminary' subject somehow is involved -  in that construction only "der" can be used. However there ought not be any need for a preliminary subject. This interpretation can be reconciled with the observation that "der" can't be included if the relative "som" is used as object in the clause. 

In some other languages the combined 'conjunctional' and 'pronominal' roles of the relative pro-word is the norm, but once in a while the language users apparently feel the need to reinforce the latter by adding another pronoun later in the sentence. As in Greek (authentic example): 

Η γυναίκα του γιάτρου <span style="color:green">που τον είχαμε γνωρίζει στο Ρόδο</span>  
the women of theDoctor <span style="color:green">whom him we-had (learnt-to-)know in-the Rhodes</span>

Here " που" is an indeclinable relative pronoun, and maybe it is to identify the doctor as the one somebody met in Rhodes (and not his wife) that leads the speaker to add the extra 'τον'. But examples like this are apparently legal in Greek because I have seen them several times.

In still other languages this 'extra' representation of the pro-word is not only normal, but even the norm -  see Murelli's text. Which all goes to show that the category known as relative clause isn't a monolitic construction. We can't assume that all languages behave as the Western languages do.

And the point of this is not to teach you about Danish or other languages, but to point out that you at some level HAVE to analyze sentence structures in order to understand the differences between two languages, and simple tools like sticks and boxes and pronominal references to outside elements are practical tools to do this. All the fine words in the grammars basically have to be translated into such models to be applicable in practice - the words alone aren't enough. 

And finally: I wrote in the precending chapter that word order can't simply be deduced from dependency structure, but there is clearly an interplay between the. In those cases where word order takes precedence over dependency structures this results in field models, where you fill out a number of slots. A classical example of this is the difference between word order in main and subordinate clauses in German. Here the finite verb in a subordinate clause takes refuge at the last position in the sentence, and in the case of compound verbal forms it is the finite part that goes to the very last position.

Dies is schön (this is nice/pretty) --->  Ich sagte, <span style="color:green">daß dies schön sei</span>  
Dies is schön gewesen --> Ich habe gesagt, <span style="color:green">daß dies schön gewesen sei</span>  (aber nicht mehr)

Another example: in Greek adjectives and possessive pronouns mostly are placed after the substantives they qualify if there only is one of them present, but if you have certain words in front of the substantive or there is both a possessive and an adjective then the adjective is moved to the position between them: "οι διακοπές μας", but "οι καλοκαιρινές μας διακοπές" ('the holidays our' resp. 'the summerly our holidays'). Again, I don't mention this to inform you about something in Greek, but to emphasize that all grammatical rules have to be formulated in simple mechanical terms to be useful. And if your grammar doesn't do this for you you have to do it yourself.
