In this chapter I'll limit myself to one wordlist system, namely the one I developed around January 2007 after I had discovered that even counting the Romanian words I knew using a dictionary had made a lot of old forgotten vocabulary come to life again (see the HTLAL thread "[Super-fast](http://how-to-learn-any-language.net/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=5307&PN=7) learning techniques"). Then maybe a more systematic use of dictionaries could do something for my other languages I thought, and I did some hard thinking about memorizing which resulted in the present system, which also is presented at the learnanylanguage [wikia](http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Word_lists), albeit in a slightly outdated form.

First of all you need a source for your wordlists, and I have two main sources for mine: intensively studied texts and dictionaries. There could be a third, namely words jotted down from extensively read texts and audio, but I simply  don't get enough new words from these sources to warrant a special treatment so they just go into whatever list I'm working on. 

When I work intensively with texts I often copy passages in them to folded A4 sheets (more handy than unfolded sheets), and I then reserve a right margin of about 5 cm for new words (more about this in chapter 4.4 , "Copying by hand"). Sometimes I just guess the meaning, sometimes it comes from the translation part in a bilingual printout and sometimes I look a word up. So the 'data quality' may be suspect, but in principle I check things properly when I do the wordlist so it doesn't matter. I write "in principle" because I have lately become somewhat uneasy about the time I waste fiddling around in all parts of a dictionary because the words I want to look up are spread all over the alphabet (or they be missing). So if  I also am doing wordlists directly based on dictionaries around the same time  then it will be more efficient to drop some of the dubious words from the text and learn five from a dictionary instead. 

Warning: I do NOT recommend beginners do to wordlists based on dictionaries. In the absence of a textual context you have to rely on intralinguistic cues to form associations, and that's much easier when you already have some experience with the language in question.

With dictionaries I typically choose a random page and choose some, but not all of the words from that page to be used in a wordlist. In some cases I have initiated a campaign where I go through the whole dictionary from A to Z (or alpha to gamma, or whatever) - like I did with Serbian in 2014 in preparation for the polyglot conference at Novi Sad. And I can feel a very clear effect of such campaigns - I may have worked with a language on an unsystematic base for years, but the progress I experience after a campaign that gives me thousands of new words in a short time is in a totally different class. But such campaigns take time away from other language learning projects, so  most of my wordlists use words from a few random pages, and then the next list will be in a totally different language. 

So what is a wordlist according to my system? Well, there is a first phase, where the original three-column wordlist is written, and the format of this kind of wordlist has not changed much since I designed it in early 2007. And then there are the repetition rounds, where I have experimented a lot (more about that below). 

So nowadays I fold a sheet of paper and divide it into three vertical sections, each of which is supposed to contain three columns. With my small handwriting I can fit around 30 words in each column, but people with larger handwritings may have to divide the sheet into just two sections, each with three columns. I fold the paper to make it more handy, but also to make the columns shorter and less intimidating. I have experimented with a layout where I made four sections: two for the main wordlist (with three internal columns each) and two for the first repetition round (with just two internal columns). I did this because I wanted to make certain that I remembered to do the repetitions - otherwise I might throw the original wordlist away by mistake before I had made a repetition round. But now I prefer keeping the original lists on one sheet and the repetitions on another, and I have learned to keep better track of my main wordlists which has solved the problem.

In the beginning I used triple columns, separated by solid lines. As you see in the sample above I use one colour for the columns in the target language (in this case Serbian) and another for the middle column in my base language (for me mostly Danish, but sometimes mixed with isolated words in other languages). But now I prefer using different colours to keep things nicely sorted out, and then I can drop the vertical lines, as illustrated below (target: Indonesian, base: Danish):
 
![Triple-column wordlist.](../2-6-image-1.jpg)

The three columns of a wordlist contain 1) words in the target language, 2) a translation, 3) the original word again. Very short word combinations can be integrated in the layout (maybe by doing a word wrap), but the layout is not suited to longer phrases. If you want to memorize an expression then give it its own line (or two if necessary). Some indications of morphology may be included, but only the barest minimum. For instance I sometimes write the characteristic consonant of the aorist with Greek verbs, and I sometimes indicate the gender of a German substantive if there are several possibilities. But adding too much information would make it harder to remember the word itself, and there isn't space for a long text. For the same reason only the central meanings should be quoted. It is tempting to add the whole lot, but your memory functions better if you start out focussing on just one or max. two core meanings. 

By the way: you may have noticed that I recalled the first two items wrongly. Normally I would have corrected it when I made the first column visible again , but apparently I forgot to do so in this case. Which goes to show that you should check that the items your 3. column are correctly rendered if there is the slightest risk that there are mistakes - but don't make it a time consuming chore. 

And finally the most important advice: learn the words in groups of 5 to 7 words. Why? because you don't learn much just by repeating a word in your head. (cheval horse, cheval horse... or even worse:  cheval, cheval, cheval... horse) .Think of something else to break the repetition, and then return to the word - <u>that's</u> where long term learning occurs. Each  sequence of words should be difficult and long enough to strain, but not tire out your memory. In the following example I try to learn Serbian words (the translations are in Danish because I'm Danish):

![Diagram showing the steps of word groups when making a wordlist.](../2-6-image-2.jpg)

So first you write the first 5-7 foreign word in the left column, check that you can give a simple translation for each and every of these words, and THEN - not before - you write the translations in the middle column with another colour. Now you make certain that you can 'reconstruct' each one of the original words. You can test yourself by temporarily covering the left column, but only when you trust that you can come up with all the foreign words, you cover the left column and write the original words in the right column. After that you proceed to the next block of words. 

If you do find that you have forgotten a word (or a translation) you can take a peek in the source or the left column, but then you shouldn't write the solution down immediately. Think about something else before you do it or take that word together with the next block. The whole point of the exercise is to force the word into some kind of long term storage by telling your brain to remove it from the immediate working memory - but not to put it so far away that it can't retrieve it.

And then relax a day or so, but not much longer. The first repetition should come while you still remember what you did to memorize each the word in the first place - associations, maybe thoughts running through your main while writing, maybe your reasons for choosing some words and leaving others aside. I know from esperience that everything counts. During a holiday on Cuba two years ago I wrote wordlists with words culled from a small Greek dictionary, but skipped the repetition round. And that was a bad idea. My Greek reading skills improved have considerably, but the words I learned during this campaign have seeped away. The repetition round is essential.

I have normally just done one repetition one day after the main event. The rationale behind this is that I found in 2007 that I remembered more or less the same number of words after round 3 or 4 as after round 2. Lately I have however come to doubt the wisdom of this, because I discovered during the analysis of my Serbian campaign that the words I remembered or had forgotten in each repetition round weren't the same ones. Somehow I ended up with around 20% forgotten words in every round, but less than half of these forgotten words were the same as in the preceding round. Since then I have done to or three repetitions, though not as systematically as I do the first one, which is absolutely crucial to the learning process.

I have been quite loyal to the three-column setup for the original wordlist since I got the idea in 2007, but I have tried many different methods to do the repetition - and as I mentioned above, for most of this time I have just done one repetition, but now I'm more open for doing two or more. 

The main repetition methods in logical order are:

1) The use of a SRS system like ANKI (see the comment below!)

2) Rereading the original source to check that you now know all the words on the list (obviously this only functions with lists based on texts)

3a) Making a simplified wordlist with just two columns, one with the translations, one with the original words.  
3b) The same as 3a, but with the <u>target</u> language words in the first column.  
3c) The same as 3b, i.e. copy the foreign words, but only add the translation if you are in doubt about the meaning of a word. 

4) For textbased lists: making a new three-column list directly from the original text instead of producing a reduced version the first list. This way you have the chance to see the original context again, and if you have worked properly with the first list you will almost certainly remember which words you had trouble with at the start - but keep the page with the original notes and the first wordlist within sight for reference. 

It took some time before I switched to method 4, but now it has become my preferred method for text based lists.

Well, I haven't tried out possibility no. 1 (Anki or similar systems) , but it has been suggested by others, and it seems like a really good combination. The only problem is that I write all my wordlists by hand, and then it is not easy to transfer them to an electronic device (except maybe by scanning a list and chopping it up into suitable pieces). I write my lists by hand because I feel I remember things much better that way. Youngster who have grown up with a keyboard in their hands may have a closer relationship with it than I have. 

Possibility 2 (checking the words in the source text)has one problem, namely that it is very easy to be complacent about the control aspect and just start rereading the original text again for fun. 

With 3c you can cover up the translation column in the original list to make this a genuine control of your results, but you can also make it easier by reading the original list through first. Sometimes learning is better than controlling. Possibility 3a is the one I suggested first, and I even devised a page setup with the original wordlist and the first and only repetition on the same sheet. It is illustrated below with words from the illustration above:

![Sample of a repetition wordlist group, native language on the left and target language on the right.](../2-6-image-3.jpg)

I copy 5-7 translations from the original wordlist, and now my task is to reconstruct the original words. This is a fairly hard task because there may be more than one translation of a Danish (or English) word, but you can get some help from the fact that most of the foreign words belong to the same part of the alphabet. 

Fairly recently  it occurred to me that this setup also would be practical in those cases where I go through a whole dictionary from A to Z (or at least a large portion of it). I visited Spain around New year 2014-15, and here I spent some hours in the evening doing Spanish wordlists based on a tiny dictionary. As Spanish is also a language I know fairly well I dropped the usual three-column format and wrote 5-7 translations in column 1 (as in pattern 3c) , and then I reconstructed the original Spanish words from the dictionary in column 2 without looking. Because this saves a lot of time I managed to do the obligatory repetition round, and for that purpose I used format 3c. 

In pattern 3b you copy the original words instead of the translations, and this is less strenuous, but probably also less efficient.  However it can be used if you go through large numbers of words during one session. Repetition pattern 3c (the one where you copy the foreign words, but only add the translation with unknown or dubious words) was not new to me, but I first used it systematically during my Serbian vocabulary campaign in 2014, where I also wanted to produce some statistical results. I realized that I had to find a way to show in an unequivocal way whether I remembered the original words in the wordlist or not, so I decided just to list all the foreign words and then add a  translation in those cases where I couldn't remember the meaning of a word or only remembered it faintly. 

During the 'Serbian campaign' in 2014 I did not one, but two or sometimes even three repetition rounds, and there I used a dot system to indicate that I still didn't remember a certain word even after doing the first repetition. So by inference green indicates a word which I remembered at the first control, but not at no. 2. So in the illustration below I would have forgotten the words with a red translation in repetition round 1, and those with a green dot or a green translation in repetition round 2. 

![Color-coded wordlist with a dot on a word.](../2-6-image-4.jpg)

With this system it became quite easy to calculate some statistics. The results aren't supposed to be scientific - I was both the test leader and the lone test person, and my assessments of how well I remembered the Serbian words were primarily based on my gut feeling (though I did consult with the original list in doubtful cases). And there is one error more in the test design: I had the translations written on the same sheet as the Serbian words so I can't claim I didn't see them (although the use of different colours makes it easier to avoid it), In spite of these misgivings I found one interesting fact, namely that my forgotten words in round 1, 2 and 3 weren't the same ones - check out the figures below for overlap! The 'loss' in  from round 1 to round 2 and 3 goes down, which indicates that some learning took place during the test, primarily during the first repetition round, but also during round 2 (to compensate for the new lost words). The red figures below refer to all the memorized words, the blue ones are the forgotten or dubious ones.

(PS I used both a Serbian-English and a Serbian-Italian dictionary for the first two letters).
