title: 5.2 Listening like a bloodhound follows a trail

Let me understand this: you can pick out every syllable, but they don't combine into words? Not even if you actually know the words? Well, now I'm going to be a bit provocative:  one reason for being unable to understand spoken words from for example TV is that people are obsessed with understanding what is being said, when the basic problem may be that they can't even parse the stream of sounds. Parsing is the process of dividing the stream of sounds into syllables and words on the fly, and to follow a stream of speech you <u>must</u> be able to perform the operation automatically. If you try to understand everything at this stage then each unknown word will block you, and you will loose the next couple of sentences. Therefore '<u>listening like a bloodhound follows a trail</u>' (or 'active listening') can sometimes be a help, even though it goes right against all the other good advice about listening to films, music etc. 

Here you deliberately don't care at all about the meaning, but try to parse the stream of sounds into sentences and words, following the speaker 'like a bloodhound on a trail'. If you have a transcript the whole thing of course becomes easier, but if you have at least some feeling for the sounds of the language you can do it without support. As your vocabulary grows and you become adept at reading the language, you will discover that the meaning of the spoken form suddenly becomes crystal clear even though you haven't tried to understand it. The meanings of those words you actually do know suddenly will pop up in your mind, but before you know enough of them they won't combine automatically into some grand meaning of the whole thing. 

When I have listened to something in this way I have sometimes seen a string of grey words running across my inner field of vision, though blurred so that only the shape of the words is seen. At other times I just listen for the borderlines between words, phrases and sentences. In both cases you should focus on changes in intonation, pauses, words you have heard before and common endings and affixes, which means that all those things will seep into your mind. Then some day the meaning appears, and you will have learnt to understand that language without passing through the perilous stage of translation.

This technique will of course demand your utmost concentration, and therefore it is counted as an intensive method, which shouldn't be applied for hours on end. 

Now this is my advice to people who can't understand spoken utterances. As I wrote above, you mostly will get exactly the opposite advice if you search for tips on how to learn to listen. For instance at the site "[Skills](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/listening-skills.html) you Need", where number 9 of altogether 10 principles go like this: 

*Listen for Ideas â€“ Not Just Words*  
*You need to get the whole picture, not just isolated bits and pieces.  Maybe one of the most difficult aspects of listening is the ability to link together pieces of information to reveal the ideas of others.   With proper concentration, letting go of distractions, and focus this becomes easier.*

So what's wrong? Who is the false prophet? 

In my opinion the beginner who can't follow a recorded speech or TV program has the choice between two strategies: 1) going for the meaning and only getting the gist, based on isolated clues in the form of single words or the context of the speech, or 2) going for the way isolated sounds are tied together for form words and phrases, but leaving the general meaning for later. The first is relevant if you are teleported to a foreign country and have to survive, but no. 2 is the intensive method that saves your skin if you want to understand everything later. 

The other 9 principles of this site are concerned with sensible things like noticing non-verbal cues and stop talking to yourself. As Mark Twain wrote: *"If we were supposed to talk more than we listen, we would have two tongues and one ear."* Those who start out early contacting speakers of their target language (like Benny 'the Irish Polyglot') may be lucky to meet individuals who speak clearly and in simple sentences to help them. And these learners obviously don't have the option of disregarding the meaning while they parse the messages of their conversation partners.
