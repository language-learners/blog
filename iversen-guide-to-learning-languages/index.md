> The Guide to Learning Languages was written by forum member Iversen, a Danish man who has stated as his next goal to be able to read all languages in Europe (and maybe a few more), and who maintains his speaking skills in about a dozen of them by monolingual voyages and participation in polyglot events. He took a degree in French and literature in January 1981, but then dropped all language activities for about 25 years because there were better job opportunities in informatics. His interest in languages returned with a vengeance when he discovered the HTLAL forum in 2006, but he has now transferred all his internet activities to LLorg, including a multiconfused [log](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1027) of immense proportions.

> Iversen's Guide to Learning Languages was adapted for the language-learners.org blog by forum member Ser in early 2019.
