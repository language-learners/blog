title: 5.4 To know NOTHING but still understand something
author: Iversen
---
If you read or listen to something in a dialect or language that is closely related to something you already know then you will often be able to understand it. The reason for this is that most words are the same in the two languages, just with some differences that reflect the different sound developments in each language. The historic linguists of the 18th century worked out long lists over the systematic changes of different sounds in different surroundings that led to the modern languages, and by rolling backwards through these changes and comparing different languages they have even been able to propose something Proto-Indoeuropean, which apparently was very different from its modern descendant on several points. But the relevant thing here and now is not how people spoke many thousand years ago, but the fact that the changes have led to parallel sound systems, so that you just have to find out which sound transformations lead from one language or dialect to its neighbour. 

Lets for instance take High and Low German ('Plattdeutsch'). They separated from a common stem several thousand years ago through the so-called Second (or High) Germanic consonant shift, which in High German among other things changed p into ff or pf, depending on the context. There is a long list of similar changes which have been traced back to just this one event (check Wikipedia for a simple overview over the changes). Other sound shifts caused changes in the vowels, such as the one that changed long u into au in High German ("hus" in Low German, "Hause" in High German), and then it is suddenly not surprising that the following sentence from "Geiht das ok 'n beten fixer?" by Ines Barber ... 

<span style="color:olive">*Suurkruut schmeckt opwarmt erst richtig goot.*</span>

... looks like this in standard High German: 

<span style="color:purple">*Sauerkraut schmeckt aufgewärmt erst richtig gut.*</span>

When the systematic side to sound shifts was discovered the linguists hoped that ALL differences between the sound systems could be explained through series of shifts, which could be put in chronological order for each and every dialect or dialect. The world turned out to be more complicated than that, but finding the resulting systematic differences is still the basis for understanding any foreign speak through something that resembles it. This means that you can guess many words in the 'other' language by applying simple phonetic transformation rules. 

But notice also the word "richtig" which is the same in both languages. I am fairly sure that the original form - if it existed - in Low German must have been something like *"riktig" (similar to "rigtig" with a hard first 'g' in Danish), because 'ch' in High German is another typical result of the second consonant shift. Such loanwords will of course not adhere to the normal transformation rules. Actually some words are borrowed twice. This can result in two words, one of which has been through a number of sound shifts which the other was spared.

Grammar changes aren't as systematic as phonetic ones, but please notice the missing "ge" in Low German. Unlike both Dutch and High German this prefix isn't used in Low German, - and on this point Low German resembles the Nordic languages. The reasons for this are not relevant for the ordinary language learner, but they show that a simple tree structure can't be expected.

If you have learnt (or discovered) a number of simple conversion rules, some facts about grammar and some of the more conspicuous false friends, then you are ready to read and understand Low German, and that is probably more than you can expect of most people from the Northern part of Germany, especially among the younger generation. 

Now let's consider a slightly more distant relative, - Albanian, which is Indoeuropean, but occupies it own private branch on the Indoeuropean 'Stammbaum'. Here the conversion rules aren't simple at all, so you have to use other methods. I visited the country in 2009, and there I bought some bilingual guidebooks to Albanian towns. Below I quote a passage with a hyperliteral translation into English from a bilingual guide to the town Korça ("Your key to Korça çelësi turistik") - the English translation in the book follows below: 

<span style="color:maroon">Pozite gjeografike</span>  
Position geographical 

<span style="color:maroon">Rrethi i Korçës shrtihet në pësën Juglindore të Shquipërisë, në Krahinën Malore Qëndrore.</span>  
District of Korça* lies in [Eastern South]** of Albania, in region-mountain(eous) Central 
      
<span style="color:maroon">Përfshin tre qytete: Korça, qendër e rrethit, Bilishti e Maliqi dhe 27 komuna.</span>  
(it) contains three towns: Korça, center of district, Bilishti + Maliqi and 27 communes. 

<span style="color:maroon">Qyteti i Korçës është një nga qytet kryesore të Shqipërisë.</span>  
TownThe of Korça is on of (from) town(S) mostimportant of Albania.

<span style="color:navy">Geographical position. The Korça District is situated in Southeastern Albania, in the Central Mountainous region. It encompasses three cities and towns: Korça, Bilisht and Maliq, as well as 27 communes. The City of Korça is one of the main cities in Albania.</span>

\* the name of the town is Korçë, the -a is a postclitic definite article, which is used here because that's what you do to feminine town names in Albanian, - and ë is a schwa sound, mostly silent in the final position of a word  
*** deliberately erroneous translation by me - see below

You can probably already now see the parallels between the two versions, helped by the geographical names which are easily recognizable. If you want to find texts which almost can be understood alone from their loanwords then don't look for common babble or serious literature, - check out scientific or historical or geographical magazines, because it is here you have the highest proportion of loanwords, and with an unknown language you need those to grasp the structure of the foreign sentences. And often this will be enough to let you guess at the general meaning of the foreign texts, - in particular if you have got some context (such as you have when you are looking at a thing in a museum and there is a label telling you what it is called in Albanian). 

With a bilingual text you can almost start building your own dictionary: "Pozite" = 'position' (noun), "gjeografike" = 'geographical', "rrethi" = 'district' etc. etc. I have assumed that "juglindore" meant South (because it ressembles "jug" in Serbian, which means 'South') and "pësën" would then have to be "Eastern", - but the capital letter in just one of the two words was confusing. I therefore took a peek in a dictionary I bought in Kosovo on an earlier trip  and the truth was revealed: "Juglindore" alone means "Southeastern" and "pësën" means 'five' (which doesn't appear in the English translation). So I had nearly misunderstood the word "pësën" - but the dictionary saved me. 

This example suggests that Albanian sentences aren't totally incomprehensible if you have some loanwords and proper names to start with. You can guess the meaning of other words ("i" = 'and', "në" = 'in' etc.), and by simple logical thinking and some guesswork you can soon extend your knowledge of Albanian, and you can even begin to dream about reading extremely hardcore stuff, such as books for youngsters and silly gossip magazines. 

And even if you don't have a translation you can still use the same kind of clues: international words, loanwords, other comprehensible words, parallel passages and some simple logic. It goes even better if you know a few things about the language, like for instance that Albanian has postclitic  articles and that the whole country is called 'Shqipëri' in Albanian. Some persons are better at this than others, but we all use such clues to understand neighbouring languages and dialects. 

However I also tried the same technique on the bilingual in-flight magazine of Maleev, and I soon had to realize that Hungarian isn't nearly as close to English as Albanian apparently is, - but after looking up most of the words I'm still fairly sure that you could learn much about Hungarian by comparing the Hungarian and the English versions of a simple airline magazine. The burning question is: would I be able to learn Hungarian simply by reading magazines or listening to TV programs with subtitles? My guess is that it would take forever, and I would end up speaking Finnish like a Spanish donkey. But as a preparation for learning to understand spoken Hungarian (or Albanian) it might function, and you could probably also pick up some of the language melody and individual sounds with your right brain hemisphere while trying to find recognizable words with the left one. 

Let me end this chapter with a slightly different topic, namely how to know something, but understanding a bit more than expected. And to illustrate that I would like to quote Krashen's "[Principles](http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf) and Practice in Second Language Acquisition", p. 20ff:

*We acquire, in other words, only when we understand language that contains structure that is "a little beyond" where we are now. How is this possible? How can we understand language that contains structures that we have not yet acquired? The answer to this apparent paradox is that we use more than our linguistic competence to help us understand. We also use context, our knowledge of the world, our extra-linguistic information to help us understand language directed at us.*

*The input hypothesis runs counter to our usual pedagogical approach in second and foreign language teaching. As Hatch (1978a) has pointed out, our assumption has been that we first learn structures, then practice using them in communication, and this is how fluency develops. The input hypothesis says the opposite. It says we acquire by "going for meaning" first, and as a result, we acquire structure! (For discussion of first language acquisition, see MacNamara, 1972.)*

*We may thus state parts (1) and (2) of the input hypothesis as follows:*

1\. *The input hypothesis relates to acquisition, not learning.*  
2\. *We acquire by understanding language that contains structure a it beyond our current level of competence (i + 1). This is done with the help of context or extra-linguistic information.*

*A third part of the input hypothesis says that input must contain i + 1 to be useful for language acquisition, but it need not contain only i + 1. It says that if the acquirer understands the input, and there is enough of it, i + 1 will automatically be provided. In other words, if communication is successful, i + 1 is provided. As we will discuss later, this implies that the best input should not even attempt to deliberately aim at i + 1. We are all familiar with syllabi that try to deliberately cover i + 1. There is a "structure of the day", and usually both teacher and student feel that the aim of the lesson is to teach or practice a specific grammatical item or structure. Once this structure is "mastered", the syllabus proceeds to the next one. This part of the input hypothesis implies that such a deliberate attempt to provide i + 1 is not necessary(...)*

*Thus, part (3) of the input hypothesis is:*

3\. *When communication is successful, when the input is understood and there is enough of it, i + 1 will be provided automatically. The final part of the input hypothesis states that speaking fluency cannot be taught directly. Rather, it "emerges" over time, on its own. The best way, and perhaps the only way, to teach speaking, according to this view, is simply to provide comprehensible input.*

In most cases people refer to Krashen's ideas using the formula "N + 1", and the usual interpretation of this formula is that you should understand everything except a couple of words here and there in a N+1 source, but as the quote above shows he is more optimistic - apparently he expects some mysterious n+1 structure to be accessible even in n+2, n+3 or higher. And he actually taunts those who try to produce N+1 materials for learners - so there the whole business of graded learners went pouff.  In fact he believed so much in this mechanism that he downplayed the usefulness of formel language learning tools like Anki, grammars etc. 

Personally I doubt very much that this will function, but using sources which are marginally harder than you can cope with here and now serves 1) to strengthen your ability to use the things you already know AND 2) to point out a manageable number of things you should make an effort to learn. With N+1 the amount of new things to learn is limited, with N+100 it would be ridiculuously high. You could still study such sources, but it would be like solving riddles. Wouldn't riddle solving work too? Well, maybe - in the long run, but the result might be the ability to solve linguistic riddles rather than the ability to use the language freely. 

The formula N+1 does NOT mean that you are restricted to ridiculously simple word combinations like "el perro blanco". Depending on the relations between the new language and those you already know and the amount of non-linguistic context, you may actually be able to start out with things at the level of Game of Thrones or the Divina Commedia of Dante Aleghieri. But in my interpretation it becomes more and more necessary to use dictionaries, grammars and translations to make head and tail of too difficult sources. And the one who already knows 2000 words in a language will be better positioned to make intelligent guesses about no. 2001 than the one who only knows 200.
