title: 2.3 Learning words from context

At HTLAL and Language Learners we have had many discussions about vocabulary learning, and a lot of members declare that they don't use formal methods like Anki or wordlists at all  to learn vocabulary - they get it all from things they read or listen to. For me that borders on miraculous - unless you already are so advanced that everything is comprehensible to you. How did that happen?

![Table containing vocabulary acquisition results in some often-cited research papers. The last column shows numbers between 5.8% and 20.0%.](../2-3-image-1.jpg)

The table above that summarizes a number of studies of 'incidental learning'' (quoted in "Second Language Reading and Incidental Vocabulary Learning" by Waring and Nation, but adapted [from](http://www.robwaring.org/papers/various/waring_120304.pdf) Waring & Takaki: "Reading in foreign languages"). The scary part of it is the right hand column, which demonstrates how low the gain in vocabulary has been from that kind of learning in a number of studies.

And there is worse to come: with one exception all the studies in  the table have used multiple-choice tests to check whether people had learned something during the experiments - and multiple-choice tests are not the hardest in the world. Actually they only test recognition of foreign vocabulary. I would like to present another report, where the test persons were tested on reading, listening and a combination - and they were checked with both multiple-choice (MC) and a translation test, which gives us a chance to compare the scores on both test types: (Brown, Waring and Donkaewbua: "Incidental vocabulary acquisition from reading, reading-while-listening, and listening to [stories](http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/rfl/October2008/brown/brown.html)":

![Scores measuring vocabulary acquisition by input method. Reading-only shows acquisition rates of 1.71%, 3.57%, 4.10% and 8.11%. Listening-only shows acquisition rates of 0.00%, 0.56%, 0.82% and 0.89%.](../2-3-image-2.jpg)

As you can see people got reasonably high scores on the multiple-choice test, but when they were asked what the test words MEANT the illusion was broken: they had barely learnt anything. Especially from listening alone the results were pathetic. If we can take this as a general tendency then the already low scores in the earlier results becomes even more depressing. Incidental learning seems simply to be an illusion.

How come then that a number of successful language learner claim that they learn a lot of words from their reading and listening? Quite simply: they don't read or listen as part of an experiment, they do it because they like to read and listen, and they have supposedly chosen things they were interested in. If you are mad about orcs and wizards and dragons and oliphaunts and hobbits and read Tolkien & co. day in and day out then you will inevitably learn tons of names and other weird terms, but unless an unknown word is essential for the plot you aren't likely to leave Frodo & co. battle alone just because you have to consult your dictionary - you just skip that particular word and hope that you get the explication later in the text. But you can skip a word thirty times without learning it. In the other hand, if you decide that the word "phial" is essential for the action (which it actually is in the chapter called "Shelob's lair") OR if you are a budding polyglot with an insatiable lust for new words then you may take the long walk to your book shelf (or use Google), and THEN you may learn it. However most readers will just take a wellmeant guess and read on. These readers may never really learn what a phial is, but maybe they'll learn enough about the word to see them through a multiple score test.
